67,According to   STARTCITE Frehill and McGrath  Cohoon  2015  ENDCITE   CITEb40  another potential challenge is that the overlap and similarities among the Information Technology  Information Systems  Information and Communications Technology  Information and Communications Technology   computing  and computer science disciplines frequently cause confusion  so what the Information Technology profession constitutes must be defined before conducting a comparative analysis across countries  6 1 Directions for future research  Relation to literature,6,Directions for future research ,Future work,1,Relation to literature

69,Therefore  in addition to the collection and analysis of comprehensive statistics  Direction 11   researchers should provide empirical evidence for each of the following arguments for the value of gender diversity in the Information Technology workforce  Trauth  2011a  pp  6 1 Directions for future research  nan,6,Directions for future research ,Future work,1,nan

71,These authors point out that  at least in estern societies  women are half of consumers of technologies  but few participate in the development of these technologies  so bringing women into technology  development teams would improve developers  understanding of consumers  needs and result in the creation of Information Technology artefacts that do a better job of satisfying those needs  thereby benefitting society and the economy  6 0 Directions for future research  nan,6,Directions for future research ,Future work,0,nan
72,Future research should investigate the validity of this argument as it applies to the Information Technology industry by investigating to what extent Information Technology professionals  independent of gender  value such support  6 0 Directions for future research  nan,6,Directions for future research ,Future work,0,nan
