10160,Extensive results carried out show that this method improves   4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10161,e obtain good results with this simple method 4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10162,However even better results are achieved when using our algorithm 4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10163,It is worth discussing these interesting facts revealed by the results of    4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10164,Overall our method was the one that obtained the most robust results 4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10165,Slightly superior results are achieved with our algorithm 4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10166,The result is equal to or better than a result that is currently accepted 4 00 Findings,4,0.0,Findings,Emperical Result
10167,The results demonstrated in this chapter match state of the art methods 3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10168,Here we compare the results of the proposed method with those of the traditional methods 3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10169,These results go beyond previous reports showing that   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10170,In line with previous studies   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10171,This result ties well with previous studies wherein   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10172,Contrary to the findings of   we did not find   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature

10175,By comparing the results from   we hope to determine   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10176,However in line with the ideas of   it can be concluded that   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10177,hen comparing our results to those of older studies it must be pointed out that   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10178,e have verified that using   produces similar results 3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10179,Overall these findings are in accordance with findings reported by   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10180,Even though we did not replicate the previously reported   our results suggest that   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10181,A similar conclusion was reached by   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10182,However when comparing our results to those of older studies it must be pointed out   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10183,This is consistent with what has been found in previous   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10184,A similar pattern of results was obtained in   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10185,The findings are directly in line with previous findings 3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10186,These basic findings are consistent with research showing that   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature
10187,Other results were broadly in line with   3 10 Findings,3,1.0,Findings,Relation to literature

10303,despite their various benefits  existing social media technologies suffer from two important limitations which inhibit sense  making  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10304,in group discussion  these issues make it difficult for analysts and supporting technologies to determine the correct message  conversation affiliations and reply  to relations among messages  aumayr et al  2011  fu et al  2008  herring 1999   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10305,however  while using such technologies  organizations have difficulty understanding discussants  actions  interactions  and intentions  mann 2011   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10306,these limitations have significant implications  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10307,according to industry surveys  three of the most important use cases for social media analytics are  1  identifying issues described in user  generated content  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10308,there is thus a need for advanced text analytics tools capable of supporting sense  making in online discourse  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10310,furthermore  by focusing at the message or discussion thread level  these tools fail to consider communication within its conversation context  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10311,collectively  these challenges can impact capabilities for identifying issues or opportunities such as customer churn  brand devaluation issues  popular suggestions  etc  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10312,product  related adverse events can have profound monetary and societal implications in various industry contexts  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10313,with the rise of big data analytics  agarwal and dhar 2014  and greater impetus on broader postmarket surveillance  the voice of the customer  voice of the customer  has emerged as an important source of information for understanding consumer experiences and identifying potential issues  zabin et al  2011  boynton 2013  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10314,however  two key challenges have impeded the success of voice of the customer listening platforms  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10315,furthermore  recent studies have underscored the need for more robust detection methods applied to these channels that can serve as decision aids for monitoring teams  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10316,the two main research questions we seek to answer are as follows  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10317,what are the relevant interactions between channels  event types  and modeling methods  and what are their implications for the design of voice of the customer listening platforms  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10318,our framework unifies and expounds upon insights and key design elements previously examined in a disparate manner  affording opportunities to better understand the interactions between channels  event types  and modeling methods  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10319,to the extent that people interpret items differently according to their own situations  the item texts function like a story  where the items combine in different ways to describe different contexts  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10320,this study explores how people responding to the same items about motivation seem to interpret these in different ways dependent on their professional contexts  a phenomenon not accounted for in most theories  and not part of standard psychometrics  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10321,our aim is to show how item interpretation may be almost be as deep a characteristic of different groups as the score levels themselves  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10322, semantic theory of survey response  claims that the most obvious reason for covariation between items is that they are semantically related  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10323,empirical testing of semantic theory of survey response has revealed that the correlation matrix of survey data can be strongly determined by their semantic properties  but not always  and not necessarily to the same extent across all groups  eg  arnulf et al   2014  nimon et al   2016   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10324,a study by drasgow et al   2015  expressed doubts about interpreting likert  scale measurements as  dominant measures  where all traits are uniformly scalable from low to high  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10325,the purpose of this study is therefore to explore the degree to which subjects from different professional contexts respond to motivational items in ways that cohere with or deviate from what is semantically expected  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10326,the contributions of this study are to   a  strengthen semantic theory of survey response by establishing a technique for assessing the mutual impact of score levels and semantic characteristics of items in differentiating between groups of respondents   b  contribute a general understanding of the psychology involved in item responses for different occupational groups  and  c  advance ways to use semantic algorithms as a methodological tool in social sciences including and not limited to organizational behavior and social psychology  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10327,information systems  information systems  strategies should therefore complement high  level organizational investment goals and identify information technology  enabled organizational changes necessary to realize them  reich and benbasat  1996   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10328,addressing this challenge  indeed  remains a critical concern for information systems strategy practice and research  galliers et al   2012  nolan  2012  ward  2012   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation

10330,building on information technology adaptation  eg  beaudry and pinsonneault  2005  and change  recipient sense  making literature  eg balogun and johnson  2005  2004   we investigate how cognitive entrenchment and associated fixity of situated practices  dane  2010  influenced the way papermill came to frame and cope with the new system during implementation and subsequent use  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10331,strategically  however  the implementation failed  as it did not produce intended organizational change  instead of creatively using the new system to enable the new strategic intent  the system was creatively implemented to reproduce existing practices  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10332,we then discuss three key factors that can contribute to strategy blindness  before concluding with a discussion of the implications of this research for both information systems strategy practice and research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10337,the business process outsourcing market has been growing steadily in recent years  σ reaching estimated us 322 billion by the end of 2016  snowden  fersht  σ 2016   σ as cloud computing and other emerging technologies offer new opportunities to business process outsourcing providers to consolidate and grow their business  singh  tornbohm  σ 2016   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10338,developments in the outsourcing market have enabled greater flexibility in designing outsourcing deals  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10339,for example  σ in accounting outsourcing  σ some may outsource a particular payroll  related task  eg payroll calculations   σ while others may choose to outsource the preparation and submission of financial statements  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10340,this emerging complexity and flexibility in outsourcing calls for a revised understanding of outsourcing motivations  σ which requires us to delve deeper from a companylevel analysis into a task  level analysis  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10341,dibbern and colleagues observed a systemic influence on outsourcing motivations in information systems  information systems  outsourcing  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10342,while business functions such as accounting may have a modular structure  σ motivations to outsource a particular process are not independent of the context of other processes  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10343,therefore  σ we theorize that motivations to outsource particular processes within a business function are related to the degree of outsourcing  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10347,we examine the influence of ideology  which we take to mean shared systems of beliefs  values  and norms that contribute to maintaining existing social structures  articulating resistance  or mobilizing action for change  fairclough  2003  van dijk  1998   1 10 keywords ,1,1.0,keywords ,Aim
10348,studies of individual and organisational responses in terms of new or changed digital practices are of particular interest  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10349,in online communities  loosely connected individual actors reveal and exchange knowledge with peers who share a common interest  faraj et al  2011  wasko andfaraj 2005   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10350,this is particularly useful when the resources required to solve the underlying problem are not all located within single individuals  but are broadly distributed across multiple individuals  boudreau and lakhani 2009  dahlander and frederiksen 2012  franke and shah 2003  hayek  1945  already argued that this is the norm rather than the exception in most circumstances  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10351,research into communities has taken up this perspective and suggested that to be successful  they need to be designed as social learning systems in which newcomers can benefit from the knowledge of more experienced members  wenger 2000   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10352,if people experience or anticipate such opportunistic free  riding behavior  this may lead to underinvestment or withholding of information  thus impeding innovation activities  gans and stern 2003   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10353,the problem is that formal intellectual property protection is not always fully effective  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10354,unlike formal law enacted by legislative authorities or contracts  these systems build on collective informal norms and are self  organized by the community  fauchart and von hippel 2008  loshin 2010  oliar and sprigman 2008  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10355,in homogenous and nonanonymous groups  intellectual property norms can be easily established  and violations are observable and can be sanctioned effectively  di stefano et al  2014   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10356,in this article  we heed the call of researchers who have postulated that  research in other settings is needed to clarify when and why norms play a greater or lesser role in regulating the use of transferred knowledge  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10357,despite these conditions  valuable intellectual property is widely exchanged  even in communities characterized by strong competitive elements  such as collaborative crowdsourcing tournaments  and the absence or relative weakness of formal intellectual property protection  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10358,our research questions are twofold  first  we are interested in the characteristics of norms  based intellectual property systems in large online communities  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10359,which technological affordances enable them  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10360,we generalize findings from this setting by developing propositions aimed to spark further research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10361,our findings are also of managerial interest  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10362,in section 6  we offer 10 propositions regarding norms  based intellectual property systems in online communities and discuss managerial implications  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10363,at this historical moment  where the digital phenomena that immerse us increasingly overflow our conventional concepts and models  our ways of studying and theorizing in research also need to undergo transformation  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10364,indeed  in locating the ongoing transformation within or between actors  we tend to structure our ideas about the fundamental nature of is phenomena in spatial terms  eg  as arrangements of bounded entities such as systems  components  modules  artifacts  users  organizations  at the expense of the temporal flow of action  eg  the rhythmic trajectories  directionalities  intensities  and momentums with which is phenomena flow   1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10365,we demonstrate the application and value  added of this vocabulary through an empirical illustration of  tcot  a collaborative  competitive twitterbased stream of political action which became an organizer of the us tea party movement in 2009  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10366,specifically  in discussing our vocabulary  we outline some guiding principles for studying and theorizing temporality  2 throughout this paper  by  transformation we aim to signal a break with the conventional duality between formation and change  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10367,instead  we aim to highlight continuous and never  ending transformation as the primary condition of all  things   or better  processes  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10368,as such  practitioners and popular culture might deemphasize the myths of heroic inventors  overinflated leaders  or hypermuscular entrepreneurs as  change agents  and rather focus more on how to cultivate the conditions under which favorable correspondences along flows of action can come about  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10369,we believe that researchers within the broader discipline  and not just process  oriented researchers  can gain valuable insights by productively resonating with our vocabulary and flow ideas to augment and reimagine their models and practices of theorizing  as we shall outline in the discussion section  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10370,failing to complete projects on time and within budget is a common problem which plagues many organisations  eg  kutsch et al   2011  project management institute  2018   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10371,as conboy  2010  p 273  states in his study on budget overruns in information systems development projects   there is no reason to suggest that this trend is improving  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10372,while people acknowledge failures to accurately estimate in the past  they generally do not question the accuracy of their current predictions  buehler et al   2010  kahneman  tversky  1982   arguing that no meaningful comparison with past projects can be made due to the perceived uniqueness of the new project  buehler et al   2010  kahneman  lovallo  1993   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim

10375,prior literature has suggested that language might play a role in some of the persistent problems of information systems  chiasson  davidson  2012 conboy et al   2012   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10376,in this study  we extend the discourse on the role of language in information systems projects by examining language usage in business cases with the aim of gaining insight into which projects are at risk of budget and schedule overruns  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10377,one explanation  supported by the planning fallacy literature  implies that adopting a view that ignores the concrete details of a project  ie  high construal level  can produce more accurate estimates  eg  haji  kazemi et al   2015  kahneman  lovallo  1993  lovallo  kahneman  2003  mitchell  2006   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10378,the philosophy of information critically examines the concept of information and its consequences  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10379,from his pragmatism  we examine his contention that the meaning and truth of signs can only be judged in terms of the consequences they make to action  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10380,we wish to suggest that understanding tangible science is directed at the production of artificial entities such as emoticons in terms of a peircean metaphysics  semiotics and pragmatics is critical to developing better design theory for the visual devices central to visual management  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10381,first  we consider the architectonic nature of peirce s philosophy and demonstrate this by describing the essence and inter  connectedness of some important work from his metaphysics  his pragmatism and his semiotics  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10382,we conclude with some potential wider inferences from this insight  namely that peirce s philosophy offers a fruitful way of re  conceptualising both the idea of information and the associated concept of an information system  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10383,in such settings  users  behavioral choice is viewed as the outcome of a conscious  reasoned decision process based on their perceptions about the information technology  eg  its usefulness   their social expectations and norms about information technology use  and their perceived control over their behavior  ajzen  1991  taylor  todd  1995   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10384,to address these challenges  organizations increasingly experiment with open idea sourcing  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10385,these mechanisms have allowed organizations to expand the generation and evaluation of ideas from a few select experts to the broader realms of the organization  possibly even reaching beyond the organization and involving customers  afuah and tucci 2012   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10386,in addition to expanding the reach of who can contribute to idea generation and evaluation  modern i nformation technology  based decision  making support allows for the granular design of task representations  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10387,judgment involves making decisions by individually assessing each alternative  whereas choice reflects the process of comparing among a set of alternatives and selecting those that are preferable  moore 2004  payne et al  1992   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10388,all contracts in the market must be known for a meaningful interpretation  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10389,in this work  we investigate conditions under which task representations for open idea evaluation using rating scales and preference markets are similar or different and the general ease of use with which the corresponding i nformation technology  based task representations can be operated  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10390,we investigate differences between the two evaluation mechanisms related to  a  the evaluation task itself  which we assess through the readability of ideas   and  b  the task perception by the user through perceived ease of use and perceived task variability  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10391,we investigate these effects by drawing on the theories of cognitive load  sweller 1988  and cognitive fit  vessey and dennis 1991   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10392,our analyses show that perceived ease of use mediates the effect of task representation on decision quality  such that the rating scale leads to a higher perceived ease of use which  in turn  results in higher decision quality  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10393,we also find that perceived task variability and readability of ideas moderate this mediation effect  such that users who perceive the evaluation task to be highly variable  ie  perceive a higher cognitive burden  and evaluate difficult to understand ideas of low readability benefit more from increased perceived ease of use of the rating scale  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10394,we make the following key contributions to understanding the parameters that improve the effectiveness of digital work arrangements for idea evaluation  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10399,rather we moved gradually towards bodies of literature after iterative open coding of our data from interviewing 29 people to answer our overarching research question  how can a digital entrepreneur  mediated by its two  sided crowdfunding platform  gain legitimacy  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10400,first  we discuss the concepts of legitimacy and digital entrepreneurship  and examine whether and how a digital entrepreneur  mediated by its platform  can be seen as legitimate  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10401,we then turn to discussing our findings before presenting the implications of this initial failed attempt at designed legitimacy and a set of propositions for future studies of digital entrepreneurship  platforms  and legitimacy building  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10402,institutional logics are  the organizing principles that govern the selection of technologies  define what kinds of actors are authorized to make claims  shape and constrain the behavioral possibilities of actors and specify criteria for effectiveness and efficiency   lounsbury  2002  p 253   1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10403,here  we examine how the balancing in information technology governance is informed by the logics the involved stakeholders enact  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10404,hospitals are an interesting context for this study because of the embedded influential professional stakeholders  von nordenflycht  2010   who bring their own institutional logic that may impact information technology governance  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10405,since we examined how interconnections between the logics that get enacted in the internal decision making affect information technology performance  the empirical analysis focused on the three above  mentioned dominant stakeholders  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10406,whereas it is exactly in information technology governance that decisions on dilemmatic choices need to be made  weill  ross  2004   which will somehow be informed by established beliefs and values  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10407,when the dominant stakeholders in this debate have diverse backgrounds  this might  even unconsciously  lead to inconsistent decisions and affect information technology performance  as was found for single implementation projects  balka  whitehouse  2006  boonstra  van offenbeek  2010   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation

10429,for instance  amazon redesigned the way we buy books  and a traffic app in a smartphone tells us when the next bus arrives  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10430,alignment generally refers to  fit   or congruence  between business needs and it capabilities  chan  reich  2007   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10431,however  in both cases  successful process innovation needs to align with the underlying it infrastructure  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10432,however  in many cases the process redesign and the underlying digital infrastructure are misaligned  ie they do not support each other  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10441,our research question is  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10442,in dealing with the research question we chose to focus on it architecture because alignment requires some architectural mechanisms that connect the redesigned processes with the underlying infrastructure  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question

10452,we view such platformization and infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation as distinct from product platformization and infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation  such as those found in the automotive sector  fisher et al  1999   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10453,in other cases  such as apple s macos  ios  watchos  and tvos  digital platformization and infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation enable the building of a powerful innovation ecosystem  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10454,digital platformization and infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation are created and cultivated on top of digital infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation platforms and supplydriven innovation  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10455,we refer to digital infrastructure as the computing and network resources that allow multiple stakeholders to orchestrate their service and content needs  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10456,examples of digital infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation platforms and supplydriven innovation are  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10457,while consumer devices can be considered  lightweight  infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation platforms and supplydriven innovation in comparison to the internet  which is more  heavyweight   cf  bygstad 2017   it should be noted that smartphones are powerful computational and networking devices serving as infrastructuring and has to control both demanddriven innovation platforms and supplydriven innovation once they scale to a critical mass  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10458,the mckinsey global institute has claimed that 60  of jobs could become 30  automated by the early 2020s  chui et al   2016   while frey and osborne  2017  argue that automation could eliminate 47  of jobs in the united states economy by 2033  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim

10460,applications of artificial intelligence are wide  ranging and include knowledge reasoning  machine learning  natural language processing  computer vision  and robotics  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10461,advances in artificial intelligence and its sub  fields have enabled the development of a new form of automation that we describe as intelligent automation 1  the application of artificial intelligence in ways that can learn  adapt and improve over time to automate tasks that were formally technologies that enable it  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10464,researchers have embraced its ability to model latent variables  correct for measurement errors  and estimate parameters of entire theo  ries simultaneously  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10465,we define ρ a as follows 1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Defination
10466,accordingly  the obtained construct scores can not be completely free from measurement error  for an excellent explanation of why partial least squares only partially corrects for random measurement error  see rigdon 2012 1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10467,although researchers have been aware of partial least squares s lack of consistency as an estimator of common factor models for over three decades  fornell and bookstein 1982    the discussion of its consequences has only recently gained momentum  goodhue et al  2012a  1 10 introduction 1 ,1,1.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10468,researchers have acknowledged the lack of consistency in the sense that parameter estimates for paths between observed variables and latent variable proxies are biased upward in partial least squares  away from zero    while parameter estimates for paths between proxies are attenuated  gefen et al  2011  p vi    1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10469,we define ρ a as follows 1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Defination
10470,since partial least squares analyses  often serve as a basis for theory development  promising research avenues might have been overlooked  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10471,monte carlo simulations of the aforementioned papers largely confirmed that the power of partial least squares is comparable to competing techniques  such as covariance  based structural equation modeling or regression on sum scores  which suggests that researchers need not worry about the statistical power of partial least squares  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Motivation
10472,we define ρ a as follows 1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Defination
10473,thus far  rather little attention has been paid to the possibility that partial least squares  if used to estimate common factor models  overestimates path coefficients  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim

10475,in social and business science  false positives are often regarded as a more severe problem than false negatives  cohen 1988 1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Motivation
10476,this opinion is also the reason why confidence levels of 95 percent or higher are often required  whereas a statistical power level of 80 percent is deemed acceptable  goodhue et al  2012b    1 10 introduction 1 ,1,1.0,introduction 1 ,Motivation

10479,social networking sites  social networking sites  are increasingly blurring the lines between personal and business networks as they enable companies to interact with consumers and government agencies to distribute information and provide services  depaula et al   2018   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10480,these attacks are complicated  difficult to detect  and could result in the theft of intellectual property or confidential information  cyber industrial espionage  and sabotage of corporate networks  vishwanath  2015   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10481,attackers can passively gather information about a target from multiple sources  including social networking sites  search engines  forums  and archived websites  and use it to actively collect information through social engineering techniques and interactions with the target or other key individuals on social networking sites  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10482,gamified systems provide a new method to design tailored programmes that not only educate users but also motivate them to learn and be engaged in tasks that they would otherwise consider tedious or difficult  hanus  fox  2015   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10483,however  the efficacy of gamified security education training and awareness interventions in the context of online selfdisclosure through social networking sites is not guaranteed for the following reasons  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10484,firstly  gamification has been effective in increasing engagement  changing behaviours  and learning new problem  solving skills in a variety of fields  osatuyi et al   2018   but not all applications are successful  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10485,our investigation follows these recommendations and applies design science principles to explore the efficacy of various gamified security education training and awareness interventions in the context of online selfdisclosure  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10487,thirdly  one of the few studies to apply gamification to data privacy training found evidence that the gamification approach increased participants  awareness about their own data privacy  but found no evidence that gamification improved learning relative to non  gamified approaches  baxter et al   2016   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10488,we contribute to design science knowledge by developing design principles  testable propositions  and realistic performance evaluation metrics  rothe et al   2020  in the context of information security and privacy  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10489,we also contribute to the literature on security education training and awareness by addressing threat  protection and vulnerability artefacts  lowry et al   2017  through the development and testing of gamified security education training and awareness interventions  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim

10492,in the is literature  firms  use of information technology has been found to be a key enabler of performance outcomes  devaraj  kohli  2003  and  more recently  innovation outcomes such as patent inventions  eg  gómez  salazar   vargas  2017 1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10493,in other words  the information technology  enabled innovation process in knowledge production was assumed to be a black box in past research 1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10494,we develop a research model that proposes information technology use to be a key enabler to increase a firm s knowledge recombinant intensity and diversity  which  in turn  influences its patent inventions  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10495,crowd working is already becoming a wide  spread societal phenomenon with both the number of platforms  eg  99designs 1 or upwork 2  and crowd workers growing continuously throughout the world  76   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10496,similarly  surveys of german crowd working platforms  eg  testbirds 3 or clickworker 4  estimate that there are about 11 million crowd workers in germany  58  76   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10497,because handling such fine  grained tasks on it  platforms renders a completely novel type of digital work  we need a better understanding of crowd work  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10498,however  with crowd work increasing  we also need a better understanding of crowd workers  as well as their working conditions  behaviors  attitudes  and outcomes  10  17  18  41  71   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10499,initial research has already investigated the motivational structures of crowd workers  11  39  44  46  69   it shows that crowd workers are not only motivated extrinsically by financial rewards but also by intrinsic motivation such as the task itself  8  51   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10500,task design is a key antecedent of work satisfaction  42  and the superordinate construct of work identification  4  48   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10501,however  the way in which financial compensation interacts with the intrinsic motivation grounded in perceiving the tasks being completed has hardly been addressed  25  78   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10502,hence  we address the following research question  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10503,more specifically  we apply selfdetermination theory in order to examine how and why the perceptions of four central characteristics of crowd working tasksthat is  autonomy  task variety  task identity  and feedbackas well as financial compensation foster perceived satisfaction with crowd work that  in turn  acts as the generative mechanism for identification with crowd work  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10504,first  we discuss related work and our theoretical background  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10505,therefore  it is the boundary resources that resolve a paradoxical tension between the generativity and control of a service system with digital technology  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Motivation
10506,we perform an in  depth analysis of 4664 technical blog articles  davidson and vaast 2009  published from the inception of the service system in january 2007 through december 2011  reporting incidents related to contested innovations that involve disagreements and disputes between apple and other actors  1 10 introduction 1 ,1,1.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10507,from our case study  we uncover an underlying cocreative mechanism by which boundary resources are created  contested  and evolve by multiple actors who are endowed with different resources  have different goals  and represent different technological regimes  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim

10510,first  the findings on the explanatory variables of digital piracy are plenty but are fragmented and sometimes divergent  as several qualitative reviews have noted  liang and yan 2005  peitz and waelbroeck 2006  lee and yoo 2009  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10511,while several studies have analyzed modified and extended versions of single theories  in which they add  omit  or substitute specific elements  eg  cronan and al  rafee 2008   the theories remain particularistic  and no attempt has been made to integrate all major theoretical approaches  although they partly suggest alternative and competing explanations for key drivers of digital piracy  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10512,two recent meta  analyses have tried to address some of the gaps in digital piracy research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10513,these findings can be evaluated through a meta  analysis by estimating the mean values and range of effects of their relationships with various antecedents  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10514,second  meta  analytic evidence obtained by aggregating empirical findings across studies can be used as an input for structural model analysis to test a comprehensive theoretical model  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10515,the proposed and tested theoretical model identifies the key drivers of users  responses toward digital piracy  integrates all theoretical perspectives that prior research has largely applied separately  clarifies alternative and competing explanations  identifies the major theoretical mechanisms  and thus guides future research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10516,for instance  the cultural dimension of individualism  collectivism is linked to the theoretical perspective of social influence and control  and in accordance with this link  the findings show that the influence of subjective norms decreases with individualism  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10517,the findings add to the discussion on the transferability of western theories to non  western countries  burgess and steenkamp 2006   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10518,to accomplish the objectives mentioned above  we conduct a meta  analysis of digital piracy literature that comprises 177 studies published in 164 manuscripts employing data from 36 countries  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10519,based on the extant digital piracy literature  we categorize the major antecedents of attitudes  intentions  and behaviors related to digital piracy  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10520,we discuss the theoretical perspectives applied to explain digital piracy and develop a comprehensive model  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10525,we conjecture that ocs create value for their participants by embedding them in the process of establishing  nurturing  and shaping spaces for knowledge flows  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10526,in so doing  we consider ocs as fluid organizational forms that are effective for sustaining knowledge collaboration  leading to innovation and other value creating activities  and requiring new forms of governance  omahony and ferraro 2007  omahony and lakhani 2011  shah 2006  von krogh and von hippel 2006  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10527,to more clearly emphasize ocs as sites of knowledge creation  we offer the following definition  ocs are collective spaces of knowledge flows characterized by a continuous morphing and are mutually constituted by digital technologies and participants  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10528,space may appear to be an unconventional notion  but we use it here to underscore the collective nature and the fluid topology in which social practices of interest emerge  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10529,our goal in the remainder of this paper is to establish how ocs provide a generative landscape to sustain collaborative relations on a hitherto unknown scale and offer novel opportunities to create knowledge and value  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10530,unconventional as this theorizing may appear to organizational scholars  even those with a strong interest in technology  we think it is warranted by the ease with which participants today socialize by enrolling digital technologies  and a trend to  domesticate  novel technologies  making them a natural part of everyday life  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10531,namely  the study aims at addressing the following research question  how does the ownership of software libraries affect their deployment  1 00 jit introduction ,1,0.0,jit introduction ,Research Question

10533,a research topic that has received the interest of both academics and practitioners in this context is the role of existing innovations in the creation of new ones  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10534,driven by the advent of open platforms and communities on the internet  it has only been in recent years that the concept of innovation through recombination has gained further attention  lessig  2008  khatib et al   2011 yu and nickerson  tuite and smith  2012  cheliotis et al   2014 senyard et al  sapsed and tschang  2014 senyard et al  oehlberg et al   2015  dasgupta et al   2016  stanko  2016   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10535,these platforms thus offer a promising starting point for innovators who apply existing ideas to novel settings  recombine them in new ways  or extract parts to integrate them into their own creations  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10536,thus far  knowledge reuse has been explored primarily in the context of open  source software  haefliger et al   2008  sojer and henkel  2010  and crowdsourcing projects  bayus  2013 gruber et al   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation

10538,for example  consuming more content per unit of time can lead consumers to deplete the content of interest to them faster  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10539,this paper aims to address this knowledge gap by studying the effect of binge  watching during free trials on subscription to video  on  demand services  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10540,several households  selected at random  were offered access to this service for free for three months  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10541,our results suggest that households who bingewatched in our second experiment subscribed less to telco  subscription vod because they depleted the content that was of interest to them faster  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10542,recommendation reminders can influence the consideration sets of consumers  in particular  if consumers would not organically look for the content recommended  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10543,however  not all types of recommendation reminders may effectively achieve this objective  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10544,these reminders aimed at attracting consumers to telco  subscription vod without giving them any suggestions for specific content to watch  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10545,the specific tv shows suggested to each household were determined using a state  of  the  art recommender system  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10546,however  several reasons may explain why firms allow this behavior  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10547,a disproportionate number of bingewatchers indicated lack of content refresh and a high service price as their main reasons for not subscribing  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10548,this difference provides additional evidence that customized recommendation reminders influenced the consideration sets of telco s consumers and increased the value they associated with the outstanding telco  subscription vod catalog after the experiment  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10549,we provide additional results in the form of robustness checks that dismiss alternative reasons that could lead binge  watchers to subscribe to subscription vod less than other households after a free trial  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10550,therefore  content dislike was not the reason for which households that obtained access to this subscription vod library canceled it after the free trial  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10551,these results provide empirical evidence that in our setting  gifts did not reduce consumers  reference prices  which  if true  could lead to a reduction in subscription rates  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10583,drivers use their own or rented cars to offer rides in locations and at times of their choice  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10584,much of the prior ride  hailing literature has emphasized flexible working conditions and driver compensation as management tools  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10585,moreover  we examine the informational needs of drivers that affect their working conditions and the implications for platform design  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10586,we find that utility and willingness to work for annual income ride  hailing platform generally increase when the ride  hailing company provides annual income minimum wage guarantee  annual income company  sponsored benefit plan  and information features that protect drivers  privacy and that allow them to screen for undesired passengers  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10590,in particular  they found that organizational anchoring  which is defined as the characteristics and conditions through which enterprise architecture management is embedded in the organization to enable  drive  and influence an organization s performance  was a core issue  26   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10591,limited understanding or lack of resources in enterprise architecture management projects are often perceived as root causes to problems  12   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10592,common to most definitions is the notion that such architects must drive business transformation in their organizations  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10593,is the idea of enterprise architecture management wrong  or is it the practical application of it that is the problem  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10594,information technology  information technology  architecture should be a means to enable this process  not hindering it  it should be flexible enough to include change  but stable enough to work as a foundation  22  34   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10595,to further advance the understanding of enterprise architecture management as a phenomenon  and continue on van der raadt and van vliet s insights regarding communication and feedback connected to enterprise architecture management initiatives  we aim to answer the following question  how do stakeholders  such as projects and other organizational units  respond to central enterprise architecture management initiatives  and what options do they have  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10603,delays between applying a decision and its effect create instability  increase the tendency of a system to oscillate  and push managers to attempt to reduce this perceived time gap long after proper corrective actions have been taken to restore the system to equilibrium  1 00 theoretical background ,1,0.0,theoretical background ,Aim
10604,even simple systems are not immune to this problem  as time delays and feedback loops between causes and effects can create complicated outcomes that are hard to anticipate  repenning  2002   1 10 theoretical background ,1,1.0,theoretical background ,Motivation
10605,to address this research gap  our objectives are threefold  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10606,to do so  we take a neurois approach  the application of neuroscience methods to information systems  iswhich excels at revealing hidden mental processes  that are difficult or even impossible to measure with existing measurement methods and tools   dimoka et al  2011  p 688   1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10607,third  we intend to determine how to reduce dualtask interference for interrupting messages by finessing their timing  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10608,accordingly  we examined how dualtask interference can be reduced when an alert is introduced between the completion of primary tasks  see figure 2   1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10609,we pursue our research objectives through two complementary studies  an functional magnetic resonance imaging laboratory experiment involving permission warnings and a realistic online behavioral experiment  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10610,interestingly  we show that when a message immediately follows a primary task  neural activity in the mtl is comparable to when attending to the message is the only task  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10611,second  we apply the functional magnetic resonance imaging findings to an online behavioral experiment in the context of a web browser warning  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10612,we demonstrate a practical way to mitigate the dualtask interference effect by presenting the warning at low  dualtask interference times  and show how mouse cursor tracking and psychometric measures can be used to validate low  dualtask interference times in other contexts  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10613,to afford such theorizing  we rely on an iron and ore mining company as an interesting context of digital technology usage  bamberger  2008  johns  2006   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10614,to reveal new insights  we rely on the notion of figurations to conceptualize how the mine used a portfolio of digital technologies to create a work space and a distributed work arrangement for maintenance of its machinery  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10615,hence  rather than seeing the social and material as inherently inseparable  cecez  kecmanovic et al   2014  orlikowski and scott  2008   we develop the notions of digital representation and digital mediation figurations to investigate  how can we empirically and theoretically account for digital technologies in the constitution of condition  based maintenance of mining machinery  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10616,as a result  we reveal how digital representation and mediation figurations entangle to produce a networked  knowledge  based work practice  with the former designating use of it to monitor and produce a work space  and the latter designating use of it to share and enact a distributed work arrangement  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10617,a platform owner can grant access to third  party participants by establishing boundary resources  ghazawneh and henfridsson 2013   such as apis and an app store  to allow complements to be developed for the platform  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10618,in management research  the term  exploitation  commonly refers to an organization s mode of learning related to efficient use of resources  march 1991   but we use the term  exploit  in its literary meaning  merriam  webster    to make use of meanly or unfairly for one s own advantage   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10619,some estimates  barnett 2011  suggest that creating a fork of the platform core saves at least between  1 and  2 billion in initial development cost and provides significant additional savings in each subsequent version if the forker manages to maintain compatibility  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10620,to address this research gap  we pose the following research question  how do openness and related governance decisions render an open digital platform and its resources vulnerable to platform forking 1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10621,because of a lack of explicit theorizing and empirics in addressing the research question  we conduct an exploratory multiple case study of google s android platform and its forks  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10622,the study covers a period between november 2007 and march 2017 and relies on an extensive web  based data set  which captures the technical and market evolution of the android platform and its five platform forks and contains recorded interpretations and rationales for platform changes  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10623,however  a close examination of this research reveals two gaps   1  none of these studies proposed and tested hypotheses on the relationship between client capabilities and information technology outsourcing success at the firm level  and  2  most client capabilities studied in an information technology outsourcing context are not information technology outsourcing  specific capabilities  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10624,in terms of level of analysis  some studies have examined the effect of client capabilities on information technology outsourcing success at the industry level  eg  han et al   2011   at the project level  eg  han et al   2013  park et al   2011   and at the individual level  goles  2006   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10625,instead  some are high  level it capabilities such as tangible it assets  chang and gurbaxani  2012   it management capabilities  han et al   2008  han et al   2013   it  enabled process integration capabilities  rai et al   2015   it skills and it management skills  goles  2006  park et al   2011   and it knowledge  skills  and expertise complementary to vendors  capabilities  tiwana and kim  2016   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10626,therefore  our study addresses the following research question  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10627,the justification for the study is that during the shift to data  and knowledge  intensive development  a shift that has speeded up since the 1990s  development  ict4d  and impact evaluation literatures have not sufficiently responded to the problems of unequal power dynamics inherent to data  knowledge intensity  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Motivation
10628,this work produces power relations beyond the oftclaimed instrumental purposes of decision support  efficiency  effectiveness  or innovation  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10629,for these reasons  it is vital to address power and practice in understanding impact evaluation and development 20  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Motivation
10630,this study features an nongovernment organisation case study critically focused on three research questions that allow us to unpack more intimately how power is generated during impact data  knowledge construction  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Research Question
10631,the methodology describes the cultural historical activity theory framework  the temporal activity chains concept  and the research design  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10632,this design features a case study initiated when a contact of the author was invited by a uk  based philanthropic organisation  imagine foundation  and their nongovernment organisation grantee  rural india  to research and consult on improving the partners  2013 to 2014 impact evaluation process  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10633,the discussion section outlines key questions and implications for researchers and practitioners who work in the development 20 landscape  and who wish to acknowledge practice and power within their work  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10634,the global market for used batteries is estimated to grow from  16 million in 2014 to more than  2 billion in 2022 1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10635,however  the decision to assign an individual battery to the most suitable application scenario is so complex and unexplored that there has been no research in this area  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10636,non  compliance  where employees fail to act according to information security policies  is therefore seen as as serious security problem  particularly in practice  enisa  2014  pwc  2014asymantec corporation  2014   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10637,the seriousness of this problem also means that employees  non  compliance has received significant attention from researchers  eg crossler et al   2013  karjalainen  2011  siponen and vance  2013   son  2011  has shown that intrinsic motivation  such as value congruence  explains employees  compliance more effectively than security measures that are rooted in extrinsic motivations such as sanctions  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10638,thus  in terms of information security  it is necessary to recognise different goals and values  ie  rationalities  as important factors when analysing the reasons for non  compliance  albrechtsen  2007  kolkowska  2009  son  2011  vaast  2007  besnard and arief  2004   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10639,according to them there is as need for an approach that balances organisational goals  eg  productivity goals  with those of information security management  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10640,consequently  information security managers need methodological support to analyse and understand the different rationalities that exist in their organisations  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10641,many studies have used existing approaches to analyse employees  compliance  eg myyry et al   2009  siponen and vance  2010  son  2011  by examining rationalities related to employees  information security behaviours  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10642,as argued by kirlappos et al   2013  and hedström et al   2011   few comprehensive information security analysis methods  information security analysis methods  exist which are aimed at supporting information security managers when carrying out as systematic analysis of different rationalities in relation to information security within an organisation  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10643,compared to the teams highlighted in previous work  the expertise coordination in the groups involved in the offshoreoutsourcing setting is distinctive in a number of ways  including their geographically distributed character  the implications of organizational boundaries  and the impact of national and cultural differences between teams  cummings et al  2009  espinosa et al  2003  espinosa et al  2007  levina and vaast 2005   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10644,in addressing our overarching theoretical concerns  we developed the following research question to guide our empirical study  what role does codification play in the coordination of expertise within the offshore  outsourcing setting  when knowledge boundaries are present  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10645,however  the precise way that digital distribution and promotion affect artists  revenue streams  with implications for incentives to invest in new content in the long run  is not fully understood  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10647,we then investigate how availability on youtube affects the type and variety of music consumers demand on other channels  piolatto and  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10648,as with many other digital platforms  youtube offers tools that allow for search and social interaction and provides up  to  date lists of the most popular videos and automated recommendations to help consumers comb through the vast amount of content available on the platform  zhou et al  2016   although its role in shaping the popularity distribution is not clear ex ante  fleder and hosanagar 2009  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10649,we estimate a difference  in  differences model to compare sales of songs with videos with sales of songs without videos four weeks before and four weeks after the natural experiments  we observe  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10650,across a variety of different specifications  our most conservative estimates suggest that removing access to music videos on youtube reduces total weekly sales by approximately 6  on average  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10651,this result is robust to a number of falsification exercises  including placebo tests and data from austria  a country that shares language and cultural history with germany but was not affected by the blocking on youtube  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10652,we discuss these limitations in the context of the related literature  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10653,specifically  we emphasize the effect of digital distribution platforms on product discovery rather than just their substitution of paid channels  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10654,digital platforms may shake entire industries  as demonstrated by the examples of uber in taxi transportation and airbnb in hospitality  de reuver et al   2018  stone  2017   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10655,when examining this definition  we can problematize  cf  alvesson and sandberg  2011   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10656,in contrast  we propose looking at intentionality as immanent in action  rather than external to it in a representation  cf   chia and holt  2006   providing a means of understanding digital transformation entangled with the impacts of technology  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation

10658,we argue that a good review article is a form of rational argumentation approaching what habermas  1990  p 104  terms  ideal speech   it ensures  that  1  all voices in any way relevant can get a hearing  that  2  the best arguments we have in our present state of knowledge are brought to bear  and that  3  disagreement or agreement on the part of the participants follows only from the force of the better argument and no other force   see also chiasson  2015   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10659,if we do not let all voices be heard  we run the risk of the three blind men examining the elephant  the review sees only part of the phenomenon without benefit of a larger context  thereby distorting knowledge of the phenomenon  just as the trunk is not representative of the entire elephant  research published in the top journals is not representative of all research on a phenomenon  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10660,therefore  creating an inclusive corpus of prior research to be analyzed is critical to the comprehensiveness of the research that is the focus of the review  boell  cecez and cons kecmanovic  2014  vom brocke et al   2015   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10661,instead  they seek to include all relevant manuscripts that fit their criteria because reviews that are unsystematic in including all relevant manuscripts suffer from subjectivity and can not claim to present a representative understanding of knowledge within the domain of the review 1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10662,second  corpus construction utilizes inclusion criteria to determine the relevance of each manuscript for analysis within the boundary to the purpose of the review  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10674,finally  we discuss our results and their implications for theory and practice  1 00 introduction 1 ,1,0.0,introduction 1 ,Aim
10675,while new public management imported ideas from the private sector designed to be instrumental in the quest for ever greater efficiency  digital government  janowski  2015  tassabehji et al   2016  places innovation at the core  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10676,in line with xue et al   2012   we use the concept of innovation in this paper to refer to initiatives and processes that require exploratory activities  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Relation to literature
10677,this bias has previously been identified by xue et al   2012  within the private sector and salge et al   2015  in their study of it investments in hospitals and is considered the result of the whole  sale adoption of governance frameworks such as cobit and itil being designed for a different setting than the present  boonstra et al   2017   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10678,in this paper  we propose that public sector organisations  albeit tilted towards exploitation  are inherently able to simultaneously employ exploitation and exploration activities  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10679,our research thus addresses the following research question  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10680,our research aims to answer the calls for research by janssen and van der voort  2016  on ambidextrous mechanisms for adaptive governance  by wiener et al   2016  on additional research into the enactment of is project control  and by cram et al   2016  on control mechanisms for innovation  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10681,through perceiving the balancing of innovation and efficiency as an ambidextrous activity  this study aims to add empirical and theoretical insights to the field  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10686,it is argued that this data  generated insight is particularly relevant in dynamic and volatile business environments  where the need to continuously innovate is accentuated  prescott  2014   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10687,the increase of organisations deploying big data analytics to strengthen their process innovation capabilities has sparked the interest of recent research over the past few years  which has examined if  and under what combination of conditions big data analytics can produce business value  mendling et al   2017  müller et al   2016  vom brocke et al   2014b   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10688,these and several other studies provide support to the idea that big data analytics resources need to be cultivated based on the type of process innovation capability they are targeted towards  bouncken et al   2018  liu et al   2018   as well as on contextual factors of the environment and the organisation  schmiedel et al   2019  zelt et al   2019   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation

10691,therefore  the research question that drives this study is as follows  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Research Question
10692,to address this research question in a more finegrained fashion  we use the resource  based view  resourcebased view  of the firm  wernerfelt  1984  as the underlying theoretical lens to identify the relevant big data analytics resources  and contingency theory to examine how contextual factors coalesce with the resources to drive incremental and radical process innovation capabilities  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Research Question
10693,building on a sample of 202 survey responses from it managers in norwegian firms  we employ a configurational approach and examine the patterns of elements that lead to high levels of incremental and radical process innovation capabilities  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10710,in establishing a foundation for our study  we note that three key modes of theory borrowing in is have been articulated  instantiating  extending  and modifying  grover and lyytinen  2015   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10711,by definition  instantiating is unlikely to provide a basis for offering much is  related theoretical insights as theory is foreign to is and the recontextualization efforts are only minor  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10712,extending encourages theory development to go beyond the borrowed theory by adding new constructs and relationships that are is  related  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10713,in pursuing our aim  we build on the literature on theorizing the it artifact  benbasat and zmud  2003  grover and lyytinen  2015  orlikowski and iacono  2001  straub  2012   develop a framework of it  rich recontextualized modifying of borrowed theories  and demonstrate this framework within the domain of is strategy  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10714,the second dimension of the framework recognizes that recontextualization can occur across two key elements of the borrowed theory  1 constructs and relationships  bacharach  1989   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10715,relationship recontextualization is chiefly about explaining theoretical mechanisms  namely  causal links  conceptual assumptions  and boundary assumptions  for the influence of one construct on another by explicitly referring to particular aspects of the it artifact  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10716,our focus on strategy has several motivations  there is much discourse around is as a conglomerate of subtopics and more in  depth discussions of each subtopic can provide a rich understanding that can guide future research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10719,it enables organizations to reach beyond their immediate resources to tap into new knowledge and skills  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10720,accordingly  research on crowdsourcing slowly transitions from an early descriptive focus on applications and cases to studies investigating specific aspects of crowdsourcing  such as crowd motivation  metrics and performance measures  and platform design  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10726,the design of information technology  information technology  artifacts is at the core of information systems  information systems  research  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10727,since the 1990s  numerous scholars have worked to develop the foundations of good design science research in information systems  design science research in information systems   for instance  in the form of general conceptualizations  march  smith  1995   guidelines  hevner et al  2004   or methodologies  peffers et al  2008   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10728,some scholars  most prominently march  smith  1995   argued that the goal of design science research in information systems was to build and evaluate information technology artifacts  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10729,arguments have been made for including a theoretical perspective in design science  for instance  walls et al  1992  gregor  2006  gregor  jones  2007  gregor  2009   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10730,baskerville  pries  heje  2010  collect some assumed characteristics of actions taken by design theory  including being of a prescriptive nature  walls et al  1992   practical  goldkuhl  2004  and the basis for action  gregor  jones  2007   principals  based  markus et al  2002   and a dualist construct  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10731,as for the latter  the supposed dualism refers to design theories covering both principles of form and function as well as principles of implementation  gregor  jones  2007  similar dualist conceptualizations can be found in  for instance  walls et al  1992   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10732,baskerville  pries  heje  2010  make actions taken by argument to eliminate the prevalent dualist assumption and distinguish between two types of design theory  design practice theory that explains how to construct actions taken by information technology artifact and explanatory design theory  explanatory design theory  that explains why a certain component is constructed into actions taken by artifact  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10733,for them  both types of design theory have intrinsic value  and for the purpose of effectively focusing one s research efforts  can be addressed independently  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

10735,in a similar vein  kuechler  vaishnavi  2012a  develop the notion of a drept  design  relevant explanatory  predictive theory  that explains why actions taken by artifact has the effects it does  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10736,if constructs are understood as latent independent  effect relationships are not fully explored  artifact construction is conceptually separated from the theoretical base and evaluation results can not be traced back to particular features  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10737,furthermore  existing notions of design theory have been criticized as being too complex and denying important characteristics of normal theory  baskerville  pries  heje  2010   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10738,while this holds the potential to create and exploit synergies between theorizing efforts in design and behavioral science  the literature does not yet provide a comprehensive discussion of how to realize such potential  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10739,baskerville  pries  heje  2010  position general requirements and general components as the two core elements of actions taken by explanatory design theory  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10740,these correspond to the notion of meta  requirements and meta  design  walls et al  1992  walls et al   2004  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10741,baskerville  pries  heje  2010  state that actions taken by explanatory design theory has a role in both the explanation and the construction of actions taken by artifact  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10742,however  how does the abstractly described relationship between general requirements and general components look in detail if the theory serves a descriptive and a prescriptive function simultaneously  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10743,we explore commonalities between theorizing in design and behavioral science  and on this basis  explore mutual learning potential  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10755,such groups have the trust and psychological safety to constructively respond to new ideas  24  42  101   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10756,enterprise social media provide a unique research opportunity to study this equivocality  which may be hard to solve in the context of offline groups  since it allows groups to self  organize and select whether to be open or closed upon the creation of the group  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10757,first  we extend the current theory on idea generation by elaborating on it in an online group context and combining it with a social network perspective to identify the contingencies of the effects of bridging and bonding ties  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10758,as such  the study underscores the importance of recognizing that organizations today have different types of groups and that different strategies for using technology to support these groups are needed  an insight with important practical value for managers of such platforms and the groups using them  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10761,despite the diversity of the three approaches to outsourcing work design  they share the assumption that suppliers should adopt the same conventions as the client for decoding the meaning of the work package as it is delegated by the client to the supplier  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10762,decrease scope of mirani  at lifewood  a chinese business process outsourcing  business process outsourcing  supplier  we use semiotics  mingers and willcocks 2014  2017  to propose a new approach that challenges the shared convention assumption in prior literature  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10763,at lifewood  we observed how work designers developed a special  purpose language supported by digital infrastructure for facilitating the supplier delivery personnel s provision of the service  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10764,first of all  this observation recognizes a distinction between the supplier work design team  ie  the organizational unit that liaises with the client  plans and designs the work  and trains the delivery personnel  and the supplier delivery personnel  ie  the organizational unit that performs the services designed by the work design team   1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10765,complementing the shared convention assumption in prior literature  see eg  kotlarsky et al  2014  srikanth and puranam 2011  zimmermann and ravishankar 2014   our research explains how information systems outsourcing can be accomplished by developing a special  purpose language  mediated through three re  representation practices  dissociating the significant ability among work design team members to replace established relationships between characters  signifying through new conventions  and embedding new conventions in the digital infrastructure  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10766,we refer to information systems outsourcing as contracting one or more information technology  enabled business process to an external service provider  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10767,iconic representations contain visual images of what they intend to signify  eg  pictures  sketches  portraits  and draw on the close resemblance to what they connote  symbolic representations are meaningful for those who understand their cultural  social or professional conventions  indexical representations are signs that point to something  independently of interpretation  bailey et al  2012  peirce 1932   tions  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim

10917,second  we examine how organisational affordances work together  to define the concept of combined affordances and to identify four combinations that create  antecedents  of collective action processes  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10918,in subsequent sections  we describe the case  present analyses of findings  and discuss contribution from our work and conclude with presenting implications for research and practice  1 00  introduction ,1,0.0,| introduction ,Aim
10919,in this regard  mobile technologies are particularly problematic  exposing employees to an endless stream of email notifications  instant messages  task reminders  message reminders  and other interruptions  all mediated via smartphones and tablets that constantly beep  buzz  and blink  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10920,thus  we argue that technologymediated  m interruptions are likely to create a chain of responses in employees  leading to job  related and behavioral outcomes  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10921,similarly stress due to interruption overload may result in workers limiting their interactions and a decline in the work  related usage of mobile technologies  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10922,overall  our goal is to examine the potential negative impacts of overload caused by interruptions after regular work hours in the context of mobile technologies  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10923,consistent with this idea  recent technostress research  riedl  2013  tarafdar et al   2010  has called for theorizing usage  related  behavioral outcome variables in technostress research  in addition to the psychological outcomes that have been the focus of much prior technostress research   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10924,we examine the effects of perceived interruption overload on the work  related usage of mobile technologies via worklife conflict  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10925,this stress likely leads them to shy away from desirable work behaviors like using work it  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10926,it seems reasonable to assume that stress may also reduce the extent to which employees use work it  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10927,therefore  our second goal is to examine  when employees are required to be accessible outside of work hours  does it matter whether they are given a certain level of control over how and when they use their mobile technologies  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10928,we suspect that control will allow employees to better manage their work and to better fit interruptions into their lives  mitigating worklife conflict and its subsequent impacts on work  related technology usage  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10929,that is  we propose that technologymediated  m interruptions will be less damaging when workers have higher levels of control  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10931,more specifically  after people have adopted a technology  they vary in how extensively they utilize the features of the system and in their willingness to invest time in learning of how to apply the system in new ways to their work  nambisan et al   1999   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10932,the latter refers to peoples  goals of finding new ways of applying technology to their work  ahuja and thatcher  2005   1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Aim
10933,more specifically  deep structure usage has a high potential for loss of time  mistakes  and errors since it is often related to problem  solving so that its demands are close to users  cognitive capacity  trying to innovate implies similar problems since it requires users to try out something new and to leave their comfort zone  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10934,thus  it is in the best interest of platform providers to make their platforms attractive and effective development environments for third  party content providers  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10935,the problematic experience of mobile application development for electronic healthcare record platforms  such as epic  shows  however  that such a seamless environment for integrating the content and functionality of third  party content providers is not automatic  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10939,for example  a lightswitch manufacturer with products that generally cost less than  2 will need a wi  fi transmitter and software to hook up to a home internet of things platform  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10940,it is also argued that a mature internet of things will require common standards within and across literally hundreds to thousands of device types for communication and connectivity and that translators will be needed to bridge the gap between legacy devices and the ones designed with internet of things in mind  macgillivray 2016  1 10 introduction ,1,1.0,introduction ,Motivation
10941,however  the reason that they need to do this is that low  margin developers  like the light  switch manufacturer discussed above  can not afford to invest in mating up to multiple wi  fi and software protocol standards  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation

10944,we first examine decisions made by a monopolist hardware  software platform by focusing on the interplay between integration tool investment and pricing decisions  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10945,the reason is that investing in integration tools and reducing the participation fee are partially substitutable actions in terms of attracting content providers  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Motivation
10946,this paper aims to provide guidance around how to trade these decisions off  because not only is the level of integration investment a crucial decision  but it is also a decision that must be carefully coordinated with pricing decisions in order to obtain its maximum benefit for both consumers and content providers  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim
10947,we also demonstrate that investing in better capabilities for facilitating third  party development may be a significant success factor for a platform under competition  1 00 introduction ,1,0.0,introduction ,Aim

11142,given the enormous uptake of webconferencing systems during the covid19 crisis  eg reuters  2020   this study s goal is to document the use of webconferencing systems that emerged at that time  3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11143,rather than testing existing theory  we adopt an inductive  or data  driven  approach to identify new themes and relationships from digital trace data  berente et al   2019   3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11144,hence  prior work on webconferencing systems and affordance theory only guide our data collection  analysis  and discussion  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11145,in light of our research goal  we sought access to data that would lead to insights into the use of webconferencing systems by many social actors in many contexts  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11146,we chose the microblogging platform twitter as our data source since many institutions  organisations  and private individuals used it to disseminate covid19related information and report on their lockdown experiences  hutchinson  2020   3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11147,using twitter facilitates both breadth of data in terms of a comprehensive view of a variety of actors  webconferencing systems use  and depth of data through a detailed analysis of selected tweets  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11148,in addition  digital trace data from twitter is naturally occurring data that can be collected unobtrusively and without being prone to biases that originate from selfreported data collected through interviews or surveys  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11149,the sample of tweets used in this study comes from twelve weeks of data collection  from march 23 2020 to june 14 2020  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11150,the initial dataset of 11 million tweets was reduced to 34 million tweets after removing non  english tweets and retweets  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11151,we also compared tweets without their trailing hashtags  and removed tweets that were 95 percent duplicates of other tweets  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11152,this step filtered out about 200000 tweets  leading to a dataset of 32 million tweets  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11153,we also did a manual check of eight users who posted a high number of tweets and deemed them spam  bot users  so we removed their tweets  25560 tweets  from the dataset  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11154,figure 1  which shows the distribution of the tweets in our dataset over time  indicates that people usually tweet more during the week than they do on weekends and that the traffic related to our search terms decreased as time progressed  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11155,we used probabilistic topic modelling  a well  established text  mining approach  to identify themes related to the use of webconferencing systems during the covid19 pandemic  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11156,topic modelling is used in information systems research to analyse datasets in various contexts  such as analysing online job advertisements to identify and compare the skills that are demanded by the job market  eg föll et al   2018  handali et al   2020   deriving the benefits of customer service management from service request tickets  and investigating the evolution of information systems research  jeyaraj  zadeh  2020   3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11157,tutorials on using topic modelling in information systems research  debortoli et al   2016  schmiedel et al   2019  guided the approach we applied  3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11158,we used the cloud  based text  mining tool minemytextcom  which employs the latent dirichlet allocation  latent dirichlet allocation  algorithm  to extract topics from the tweets in our dataset  blei et al   2003   3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11159,this algorithm models a document as being composed of a fixed number of topics with proportions from 0 percent 3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11160,in a similar fashion  a topic is modelled as a probability distribution of words  and then extracted topics are interpreted manually  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11161,using debortoli et al  s  2016  tutorial  we evaluated various numbers of topics  from 20 to 100 topics in steps of 10  and used the semantic coherence metric to evaluate these topic models automatically  3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11162,in particular  we applied the method lau and baldwin  2016  propose  which builds on lau et al   2014   who take pairs of terms present in the top n words used in addressing a topic and calculate how often these pairs cooccur in a narrow  sliding window over a reference corpus  3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11163,this calculation results in a normalised pointwise mutual information  normalised pointwise mutual information  score that ranges between −1  worst  and 1  between −1 worst and 1   3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11164,table a1 shows the computed normalised pointwise mutual information score for each topic model that results from averaging its normalised pointwise mutual information scores for different numbers of top n words  ie 5  10  15  and 20  to increase the reliability of the metric  lau  baldwin  2016   3 10 research method ,3,1.0,research method ,Method
11165,then we performed a qualitative evaluation of the coherence of the topic models with 20  30  50 and 60 topics and selected the topic model with 50 topics  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11166,this model differentiates the topics better than those of coarse  grained models  ie 20 and 30 topics  while the added complexity of the model with 60 topics did not provide additional valuable information  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11167,our final topic model for the analysis undertakes four natural  language pre  processing steps  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11168,the tool names used in the data collection are removed along with other frequent words  as these words do not add new information to the tweets and might hamper interpretation of the topics  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11169,the topic modelling resulted in fifty topics that we labelled and categorised as shown in table a2  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11170,having initially analysed and aggregated findings according to those categories  we decided to exclude topics that were associated with the education context  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11171,the wcsenabled sudden digitalisation of all levels of education is a large  scale phenomenon of the covid19 crisis  so it is also diffuse  as it pertains to various types of educational institutions  primary and secondary schools  universities  and stakeholders  instructors  learners of all ages  parents   3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11172,given the scale of this category and its associated topics  we felt that this category deserves a separate study  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11173,we performed topic modelling on a sample of our 32million  tweet dataset to streamline the topicextraction process  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method
11174,we randomly sampled 50 percent of the tweets from the first six weeks  1950844 tweets published between march 23 2020 to may 3 2020  and used the resulting topic model to assign topics to the remaining tweets  3 00 research method ,3,0.0,research method ,Method

11188,representatives of the swedish tax authority board had expressed concern that the current level of innovation in the agency was sub  optimal  and as a result  they felt falling short of the potential benefits of digital transformation  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11189,to address this issue  they invited us to analyse the situation to determine  what is going on  and identify potential issues of improvement in it governance  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11190,the main objective was to investigate the enactment of ambidextrous it governance  which focused particularly on the underlying assumptions in the existing governance  and the balancing of innovation and efficiency in both governance and operations suggested by the organisational ambidexterity literature  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11191,the case study was conducted between fall 2016 and spring 2017 and was finalised through a written report and two executive briefings to the board  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11192,the rationale for the separate study on it governance enactment at the social insurance agency was to gain insight into the existing practices surrounding it governance and its effect on the organisational ambidexterity of the agency  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11193,after two initial meetings in spring 2017  we presented a project plan involving support in terms of quality assurance for the digital agenda and a request to conduct a separate case study to investigate ambidextrous it governance enactment  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11194,the case study at social insurance agency was conducted in 2017 and finalised through a written report on the current state of the art of ambidextrous it governance in the agency in 2018  and a development board briefing in 2019  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method

11197,the data sources included a series of workshops  secondary material in the form of it governance steering documents  consultancy reports  financial reports  and project charters  and continuous email communications between the research group and a representative from the swedish tax authority  table 1   3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11198,the rationale for this selection of secondary material was to gain a broad insight into the history  seen in the consultancy reports  and current practice  as seen in the steering documents  project charters  budgets  and survey  surrounding ambidextrous it governance enactment  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11199,the second author carried out the data collection for the social insurance agency case over an eight  month period  may  december 2017   including semi  structured interviews  meetings  a workshop  and a collection of secondary material including steering documents  consulting reports  financial reports  and project charters of the development portfolio  inspired by the first case study  see table 2   3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method
11200,the project charters served to confirm and disconfirm interpretations we made throughout the data analysis process  giving us a plentiful of qualitative indications  to be also reflected further by the interview data  to confirm that social insurance agency found  indeed  itself in a similar situation as swedish tax authority  3 00 method ,3,0.0,method ,Method

11212,especially in relation to the emerging area of big data analytics  little is known about what are the core resources that help drive a firm s process innovation capabilities  and even less regarding the role of organisational factors and aspects of the environment in shaping these requirements  ebner et al   2014  torres et al   2018   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11213,contingency perspectives and subsequent literature on the effect of contextual factors highlight the importance of examining such elements simultaneously  as looking at these in isolation may yield biased results and obscure some important unobserved contingencies  chakravarty et al   2013   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11214,the survey method was deemed appropriate to actualise the objectives of the study since it provides generalisationa of outcomes  allows for easy replication  and provides an effective way of exploring simultaneous relationships between a large number of factors  pinsonneault  kraemer  1993   straub et al   2004  underscore the importance of survey  based research in exploratory settings and predictive theory  3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11215,furthermore  studies that employ configurational approaches of data analysis most commonly use survey data to explore firm  level phenomena  fiss  2011   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11216,accordingly  for the purposes of this study a survey was developed that contained questions relating to investments in big data analytics resources  the structure and culture surrounding such technologies  gupta  george  2016   the environment  newkirk  lederer  2006   as well as process innovation capabilities  subramaniam  youndt  2005   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11217,the constructs and corresponding survey items used in this questionnaire  are largely based on previously published latent variables with psychometric properties that support their validity  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11218,a small  cycle pre  test was conducted with 23 firms prior to the main study to determine the statistical properties of the measures  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11219,the firms contacted as part of the pre  test were not included in the final sample of responses and came from senior it managers of companies operating in norway  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11220,respondents were contacted via email and asked to fill out an electronic version of the survey  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11221,through the pre  test procedure  we were able to assess the face and content validity of items and to make sure that key respondents would be in place to comprehend the survey as intended  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11222,furthermore  examples of key definitions were given to respondents including those of big data  ie   large structured and unstructured data sets that require new forms of processing capability to enable better decision making and are characterized by their volume  velocity  variety and veracity    and big data analytics capabilities  ie   big data analytics capability is the ability of the firm to capture and analyze data towards the generation of actionable insights  by effectively deploying its data  technology  and talent through firm  wide processes  roles and structures    as well as the defining characteristics of big data through the four v s of volume  variety  velocity  and veracity  mikalef et al   2018b   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11223,30 and were examined with the same criteria as in the main study  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11224,regarding the phone interviews  the comments from each respondent were noted  and questions on specific items were asked as well as for the whole survey and its presentation  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11225,in addition  some minor modifications were made in the phrasing  presentation  and user interface of the survey instrument in response to feedback received  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11226,for the main study  we used a population of 500 firms from a list of norway s largest companies  measured in terms of revenue  kapital 500   3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11227,after the introductory phone contact  an email invitation was sent out to respondents to participate in the study and complete the online questionnaire  followed by two email reminders  each separated by a two  week interval  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11228,furthermore  a personalised report was promised benchmarking each respondents company to country and industry averages obtained from the final data  in order to incentivise them to complete the survey and increase response rates  sax et al   2003   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11229,the data collection process lasted approximately 6 months  february 2017 july 2017   and on the average completion time of the survey was 14 min  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11230,the online questionnaire tool used allowed us to track respondents that started but did not complete the survey  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11231,furthermore  there was the option of saving progress in the survey and continuing it at another time  which was as an effective way to reduce incomplete responses  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11232,the largest proportion of the sample were firms operating in the banking and financial services sector  138    followed by consumer goods  108    oil  gas  104    industrials  94    while a large proportion came from a variety of other sectors  371    3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11233,the vast majority were large firms  accounting for 648  of the sample  while a considerably less  but still substantial amount came from sme s  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11234,the presence of sme s when looking at the data can be attributed to firms that are subsidiaries to larger parent companies  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11235,the respondents in our sample documented varied experience when it came to big data analytics projects  with most having 2  3 years of experience  262    3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11236,furthermore  the respondents held positions that fit with our initial design  since they occupied roles bridging the business and it domains within their firms  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11237,with non  response bias being a common problem in large  scale questionnaire studies  we took measures both during the collection of the data to ensure we had a representative response rate  as well as after the concluding of the data gathering  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11238,since all data were collected from a single respondent  we employed a series of measures to exclude the possibility of typical bias  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11239,to determine if there is a risk of method bias in our sample  we adhered to the guidelines of podsakoff et al   2003  and applied several measures to reduce the potential severity of common method bias  3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11240,ex  ante  respondents were assured that all information they provided would remain anonymous and confidential  and that any analysis would be done on an aggregate level for research purposes solely  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11241,ex  post  we conducted a harmon one  factor tests on the main variables of our study  data  technology  basic resources  managerial skills  technical skills  data  driven culture organisational learning  and incremental and radical process innovation capabilities  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11242,the results did not yield a uni  factor solution and the maximum variance explained by any one factor was 276   a strong indication of an absence of common method bias  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11243,in addition  to determine if there was any nonresponse bias in our sample  the profile of the respondents was compared with those on the mailing list we collected for each company  such as size and industry of operation  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11244,the chi  square analysis revealed no systematic response bias in the types of companies  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11245,in addition to nonresponse  we also examine late  response bias by comparing early  first 2 weeks  and late responses  lateresponse bias by comparing early first 2 weeks and late responses 2 weeks  through chi  square tests for firm size  industry  expenditure  and firm experience with big data  as well as for the main dimensions of the instruments that were used as part of the study  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11246,finally  we looked at within  industry differences in reported environmental uncertainty and found no statistically significant differences for the measures used in this study throughout the industries with a sufficiently large representation  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11247,we build on the concept of big data analytics capability from the study of gupta and george  2016  to determine all relevant resources  mikalef  krogstie  2018   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11248,this concept distinguishes between the three underlying pillars which are big data  related tangible  human skills  and intangible resources  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11249,specifically  within the tangle big data resources  we distinguish between data  technology  and basic resources  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11250,finally  in relation to intangible resources  we include a data  driven culture and the intensity of organisational learning as two core resources  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11251,each of the previously mentioned concepts is measured on a 7point likert scale  following the study of gupta and george  2016   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11252,since the research design contains both reflective and formative constructs  we used different assessment criteria to evaluate each  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11253,values below 085 are an indication of sufficient discriminant validity  hence  the obtained results confirm discriminant validity  appendix c   3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11254,while all the indicators weights for data and technology resources were statistically significant  one of the two indicators weights  br2  of the basic resources construct was found to be non  significant  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11255,since br2 items captures the time needed for big data analytics projects to deliver the value we have opted to keep it in the basic resources construct  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11256,several empirical studies  as well as practice  based reports have indicated that big data analytics initiatives require time to mature and to produce value  so it is therefore considered as an important component of the overall capability and value creation mechanism ransbotham et al   2016   gupta and george  2016  follow a similar approach in their operationalisation of big data analytics capability  3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11257,all values in our study were below the threshold of 33 indicating that multicollinearity was not an issue  as shown in table 3  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11258,following the configurational perspective that this study adopts  we use fuzzy  set qualitative comparative analysis  fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis   a set theoretic method  which can explore how key elements coalesce to explain an outcome of interest  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11259,specifically  for the objectives of this research  fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis is deemed as a suitable tool to determine what big data analytics resources and contextual factors of the environment and the organisation are most important in the formation of incremental and radical process innovation capabilities  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11260,compared to variance  based methods that identify correlations between independent and dependent variables  fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis seeks patterns of elements that lead to a specific outcome  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11261,furthermore  fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis can overcome some of the limitations of cluster analysis methods  which typically seek clusters of homogeneous cases based on empirical quantitative data  without a theoretical foundations and control over the outcome  park et al   2017   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11262,thus  cluster analysis methods are limited in their ability to explain how clusters are formed  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11263,the procedure followed by transforming continuous variables into fuzzy sets is grounded on the direct method proposed by c c ragin  2009a  and the suggestions of schneider and wagemann  2010   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11264,to do this we used the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis 30 software package  which transforms a variable into a fuzzy set using the metric of log  odds and the distance of the variables value from the crossover point with the values of full membership and full non  membership as the upper and lower bounds  c c ragin  2009a   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11265,according to the procedure  the degree of set membership is based on three anchor values  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11266,since this study uses a 7point likert scale to measure constructs  the guidelines put forth by ordanini et al   2014  and fiss  2011  are followed to calibrate them into fuzzy sets  3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11267,these values were set for the main analysis  ie  for high process innovation solutions   nevertheless  to further validate our calibration 3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11268,we conducted several sensitivity analyses  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11269,the same method of calibration is applied to the other variables used as predictors  with the only exception being the categorical ones of size  class and type of industry  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11270,in doing so  we follow past empirical literature using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis which uses mutually exclusive categories in the form of a binary variables for the purposes of the analysis  and to reduce the number of possible remainder rows  c c ragin  2005  greckhamer et al   2008   3 10 methodology ,3,1.0,methodology ,Method
11271,to make results more comprehensible  in the analysis section we have represented binary variables as two dummy variables  eg  a value of 0 in the size  class variable is represented as a 1 in the item 3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method

11275,we responded to all these objectives by first mapping developments  opportunities  and challenges related to the harnessing of economic value in iot the data collection and analysis process of this article follows the principles for systematic literature review  eg brereton et al   2007  applied to the nternet of things space  3 10 our methodology ,3,1.0,our methodology ,Method
11276,we performed a detailed literature review in three main areas  technical  economic and social  3 00 our methodology ,3,0.0,our methodology ,Method
11277,this was an iterative process that used a range of primary and secondary sources  from academic publications to governmental  business and consultancy reports  3 00 our methodology ,3,0.0,our methodology ,Method
11278,data collections and analysis were performed by the authors and checked for validity and breadth by two other reviewers  3 00 our methodology ,3,0.0,our methodology ,Method

11285,first  we conducted a literature review  second  we iteratively designed our taxonomy  third  we evaluated and revised our taxonomy using expert interviews  and fourth  we conducted a validation of our taxonomy using two cases  thereby completing its development  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11286,to cover a broad set of publications  we used the keywords  gamification  and  gamification elements  or  game design elements  when undertaking a search across six databases  acm  ebsco  emerald  ieee  ais  and jstor  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11287,we decided to use nickerson et al  s  2013  approach because it is the most prominent and widely used approach in the field  and because it offers the most systematic and step  by  step method for developing taxonomies while guaranteeing a complete identification of dimensions and the characteristics of objects  an overview of nickerson et al  s 2013 development is provided in figure 3   3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11288,this helps researchers eliminate irrelevant characteristics from the taxonomy and should be based on the target group for which the taxonomy is being designed  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11289,accordingly  expert interviews were used to analyse our taxonomy and determine its usefulness in developing and understanding gamification concepts among practitioners and researchers  3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method
11290,accordingly  two cases were presented for the final step of our taxonomy s development  one to test the analysis  the other to test the design of gamification concepts 3 00 methodology ,3,0.0,methodology ,Method

11343,we studied the community in depth using multiple methods  jick 1979   4 10 multimethod case study ,4,1.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11344,finally  we carried out a field experiment to test the extent to which the norm system is merely  cheap talk  or works effectively  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11345,we did so by intentionally violating norms  we copied 64 existing designs  submitted them under false names  and observed what happened  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11346,threadless has a crowdsourcing platform on which designers submit innovative t  shirt designs and other community members vote and give feedback on the designs  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11347,first  it has strong cooperative elements  as community members reveal their intellectual property on the platform by posting draft designs and asking for feedback before entering a design in the competition  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11348,intellectual property issues are highly relevant for participants because they retain the rights to their intellectual property until threadless selects the t  shirt design for production  after which the rights are transferred to the company  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11349,piller  2011  reported 25 million unique visitors in august 2010  and threadless indicates that it has 32 million anonymous and self  selected participants who average between 34000 and 60000 visits to the site on any given day  jeff guerrero  artist and community liaison at threadless  email may 2  2014   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method

11352,like traditional ethnography  netnography is a naturalistic method that provides researchers with a window into naturally occurring behaviors  kozinets 2002   4 10 multimethod case study ,4,1.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11353,user behavior is captured and stored automatically on the web  meaning that data do not necessarily have to be collected in real time  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11354,our data collection and analysis followed an iterative process  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11355,because of the vast amount of data  billions of posts on threadlesscom   it was critical to search for relevant cases systematically  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11356,in multiple steps  a panel of 15 trained research assistants  all of them familiar with the threadless community  developed a search heuristic based on a list of 10 keywords   already printed    copied design    copied my    copy  paste    existing design    imitation    intellectual property    rip off    same design    zero    4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11357,this initial search resulted in a database of 1224579 discussion posts that were subsequently screened for intellectual property issues by the team  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11358,the comments included many false positives  ie  search results that did not relate to intellectual property violations  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11359,eventually  we identified 196 threads with 6424 posts for further analysis  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11360,among them  155 threads were triggered by an alleged design copy case  while the remaining 41 contained more general discussions about intellectual property violations  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11361,we analyzed the relevant comments using open coding  strauss and corbin 1990  to identify first  order concepts  ie  themes regarding the handling of intellectual property issues that recurred consistently throughout the 6424 discussion posts  4 10 multimethod case study ,4,1.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11362,we then used axial coding  miles and huberman 1994  strauss andcorbin 1990  to group the first  order concepts into second  order concepts  resulting in a set of seven distinct norms for the handling of intellectual property in the threadless community  4 10 multimethod case study ,4,1.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11363,throughout our analysis  we paid close attention to the context of each case  such as the specifics of the copied design or particularities in the way in which the violation was handled  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11364,therefore  we triangulated our database with two more data sources  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11365,the objective of the survey was to find out whether or not the norms  based intellectual property system we reconstructed using netnography matches the perceptions of the threadless community  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11366,in the questionnaire  we asked   in the following  we have listed some rules about copying designs that might or might not apply to the threadless community  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11367,to ensure comprehensibility  we conducted a pretest based on a convenience sample with n  52 respondents  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11368,the link to the online survey was posted on the community site by a threadless community manager together with a call for participation  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11369,the survey remained online for six weeks  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11370,as threadless was not able to provide us with demographic information on its community members  its composition changes permanently and the number of incomplete profiles   dead  accounts  and double entries is unknown  we could not compare the sample characteristics with the overall population  see table a1 in the appendix   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11371,on a qualitative basis  threadless members assessed the sample as representative of the community  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11372,a comparison of early and late respondents showed that there is no significant difference between the groups except for the control variables visits to website  p  0 01  and interaction with other members  p  0 01   which means that highly active threadless community members are overrepresented in our survey sample  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11373,to analyze the consequences of this bias  we segmented our data in various ways  members with versus without submitted designs  frequent versus occasional visits to the website  frequent versus occasional interaction with other members  and compared active participants with less active participants  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11374,these intrasample comparisons showed no significant differences in opinions about the norms  which suggests that the findings might be generalized to the community as a whole  see also section 6   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11375,one potential threat in surveys on value  laden topics such as ethics or social norms is social desirability  grimm 2010  randall andfernandes 1991   4 10 multimethod case study ,4,1.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11376,we developed a web crawler to search the threadless platform for all interactions in which the survey respondents were involved   85000 posts   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11377,the overall result of our validation study is convincing  we found discrepancies in only 09  of all cases where a user indicated adherence to a norm  1 or 2 on a five  point likert scale   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11378,in sum  the data from the survey appear sufficiently valid  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11379,to provide further corroboration  we conducted a field experiment  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11380,with the full consent of threadless  each week we randomly selected three designs from all of the submissions threadless had received that week  resulting in a total of 64 designs  see table a2 in the appendix   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11381,our sample included frequently rated designs as well as submissions that were seen and scored by only a few people  number of scores received  mean  27288  sd  13053   4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11382,during this delay period  roughly 1200 other designs were submitted  which means that the detection of the copy was by no means trivial  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11383,we randomly varied the exact days on which we submitted the three copies and stretched the experiment over a period of six months to avoid generating  artificial  alertness due to potentially recognizable patterns or an excessive number of violations  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11384,upon detection  we took screenshots of the immediate user reactions for further analysis  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11385,our agreement with threadless stipulated that as soon as someone detected the copy  both the design and the profile used to submit the design would be removed  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method
11386,to not endanger the test  we did not inform the original designers  4 00 multimethod case study ,4,0.0,multimethod case study ,Method

11430,our design science research goals are to generate prescriptive knowledge  gregor  hevner  2013   by establishing design principles for a gamified security education training and awareness artefact that can reduce online selfdisclosure  avdiji et al   2020   4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11431,in order to generate these design principles  we developed testable propositions  gregor  jones  2007   4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11432,we designed an objective  centred solution  peffers et al   2007  and relied on rigourous methods in the construction of this artefact by reviewing the gamification literature and learning about features that may work well in our context  4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11433,accordingly  we established suitable scope and boundaries and developed a prototype  hevner et al   2004  of a gamified security education training and awareness artefact with cyoastyle interactive storytelling  hevner et al   2004  s design science research guidelines provided a structured path in using design science research methodology in designing the gamified security education training and awareness artefact  4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11434,figure 1 presents the research activities that we followed in designing the gamified security education training and awareness artefact  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11435,we developed a security education training and awareness artefact for reducing online selfdisclosure by applying the two learning design principles described earlier  storybased agent and reflection  as well as relevant requirements for is security training proposed by karjalainen and siponen  2011   4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11436,for the gamification aspects  we relied on helms et al   2015  s taxonomy of game elements as well as liu et al   2017  s general principles for designing gamified systems  4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11437,we relied on the literature to surface the most relevant game elements for a security education training and awareness artefact  keeping in mind liu et al   2017  s recommendation that game design elements should be chosen to create the desired user  system interactions and experiential and instrumental outcomes  4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11438,assessing user experience using reliable and valid measures is an essential step for designing and evaluating a gamified security education training and awareness artefact since user experience is an important indicator of the overall success of 2010  and gregor and hevner  2013   4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11439,the dashed boxes indicate the iterative design processes  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11440,therefore  we aimed to create a gamified security education training and awareness artefact that would be memorable  easy to use  and result in high user satisfaction and usability  helms et al   2015  identified seven categories of game elements  progression  rewards  rules  social  competition  communication  and general  4 10 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,1.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11441,appendix a maps the game design elements to those used in our training  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11442,recall that our goal was to create a gamified security education training and awareness artefact that reduced online selfdisclosure by contextualising the training to the participant s online selfdisclosure proclivities  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11443,thus  the gamified security education training and awareness artefact used interactive storytelling to  1  determine the security threats  that each participant was most susceptible to   2  debrief the participant about each threat and its potential causes  and  3  facilitate behaviour change by letting him or her re  evaluate the decision that led to the threat  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11444,we identified five common types of threats based on our synthesis of the literature and news articles  and the unstructured data acquired through the belief elicitation process  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11445,therefore  we designed our storyline to reflect the five security threats we identified as consequences  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11446,by depicting scenarios that participants could imagine experiencing in reality  the stories offered a streamlined  surrogate experience  sole  wilson  2002   4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11447,the storyline included various decision points where participants could alter the course of events throughout the scenario  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11448,therefore  the participants could complete the interactive storyline following several different sequences based on their decisions  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11449,additionally  participants  decisions shaped how the story would end  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method
11450,by identifying a consequence based on the participant s decision  we were able to debrief the participant on a particular security threat by providing a consequence  specific debriefing  4 00 method  building the security education training and awareness artefact ,4,0.0,"method : building the security education, training, and awareness artefact ",Method

11457,these results jointly suggest that knowledge recombinant intensity and diversity partially mediate the effect of information technology use on patent quantity and fully mediate the effect of information technology use on patent quality breadth and depth  4 00 results ,4,0.0,results ,Emperical Result
11458,the ordinary least squares results should be interpreted as association rather than causation  4 00 results ,4,0.0,results ,Emperical Result
11459,thus  we conclude that our results are not driven by reverse causality  4 00 results ,4,0.0,results ,Emperical Result
11460,we performed an exhaustive search of published and unpublished studies providing estimates of antecedents of digital piracy attitudes  intentions  and behaviors  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11461,to identify relevant studies  we first searched several review articles  liang and yan 2005  peitz and waelbroeck 2006  lee and yoo 2009  examining their references and applying an ancestry tree search by searching for all articles referring to the review papers in the web of science database and on google scholar  4 10 method data collection and coding ,4,1.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11462,second  we performed a keyword search of electronic databases  such as business source complete  jstor  psyinfo  proquest dissertations  these s  and google scholar   using keywords such as  file sharing    piracy   or  pirat    combined with  digital    software    music   and  movie   4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11463,third  once a study was identified  its references were examined to search for further studies  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11464,this study retrieval approach is consistent with recommendations in the literature  eg  hunter and schmidt 2004   4 10 method data collection and coding ,4,1.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11465,the sample of this meta  analysis includes journal articles  book chapters  working papers  unpublished these s  and conference proceedings  thus reducing the risk of a biased representation of the state of research because of the source of publication  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11466,after identifying manuscripts for potential inclusion in the data set  we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine which manuscripts would be retained  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11467,we included all manuscripts that reported on empirical studies based on samples of  prospective  users of pirated digital material and quantitatively measured and provided estimates regarding any of the antecedents of users  attitudes toward digital piracy  intentions to pirate  and actual pirating behaviors  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11468,in particular  we did not consider studies that investigated aggregate data such as piracy rates per country  instead  we focused on studies that investigated individual data  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11469,we also excluded studies that did not provide sufficient data for the purpose of our meta  analysis  such as those that lacked enough statistical information to calculate a correlation coefficient and for which the necessary information could not be retrieved from the authors  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11470,apart from these exclusions  we considered any manuscripts that provided the appropriate empirical data  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11471,our search resulted in an initial set of 174 usable manuscripts that included 185 studies with independent samples and that reported on one or more estimates for any antecedent of digital piracy attitudes  intentions  or behaviors  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11472,two coders  the author and one student assistant who was selected  hired  and trained for the coding task  independently coded the data and assigned the antecedents to a predefined set of variables of interest that were extracted from prior review studies  liang and yan 2005  peitz and waelbroeck 2006  lee and yoo 2009  4 10 method data collection and coding ,4,1.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11473,the initial coding yielded 93  agreement on antecedents that fit the coding scheme  and the majority of variables could be assigned to the categories  because most of the variables are unambiguously labeled in the primary studies  eg  age  gender  subjective norms   4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11474,eisend  digital piracy meta  analysis information systems research  2019  vol  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11475,to code these variables and to assign them to broader categories  the procedure applied in other meta  analyses was followed  eg  pick and eisend 2016  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11476,to that end  the definitions and measurement models of the variables were carefully examined to ensure that only variables from the same nomological network were combined  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11477,any antecedent that appeared either only in one or two independent studies or in only one manuscript was eliminated from further analysis  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11478,this was done to ensure a minimum degree of generalizability  because a meta  analysis should provide a high degree of generalization and thus more information than a single manuscript or a single  study manuscript that is followed by a replication study  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11479,the selection of estimates left us with 164 manuscripts to be considered in the meta  analysis  with 15  of the manuscripts being unpublished   4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11480,some manuscripts reported on more than one relevant study  eg  different country samples   while multiple manuscripts reported estimates based on data from a singlestudy sample  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11481,ultimately  the 164 manuscripts included estimates from 174 studies with independent samples collected in 36 countries  1 which provided 1373 effect size estimates describing the relationships between any antecedent and digital piracy attitudes  intentions  or behaviors  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method
11482,the combined sample size includes 63662 users  4 00 method data collection and coding ,4,0.0,method data collection and coding ,Method

11510,this section is as hands  on description of the valuebased compliance method  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11511,in relation to each step we also present examples of the method s demonstration in the hospital setting  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11512,the valuebased compliance method consists of nine steps  as illustrated in fig  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11513,for example  during our demonstration at the hospital we decided to focus our study on information security aspects that are related to patient information because treating patients is the hospital s main activity  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11514,in addition  we used the county s overall definition for information security as our working definition  and subsequently as the demarcation for our analysis    correct information to the right people  right on time  and to the right place   4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11515,the organisational boundary for the study consisted of the hospital s medical and surgical clinics  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11516,when we applied the valuebased compliance method at the two clinics  as number of relevant information security documents were collected  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11517,these regulate information security practice  eg information security policy  it strategy and routines for handling medical records  at the county council level as well as at the hospital level  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11518,hence  abstract and detailed descriptions about the same isa are grouped together in order to reduce the number of action statements that need to be worked on in the on  going analysis  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11519,this step is aimed at deepening the understanding of policy design and the design rationale  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11520,hence  the focus of the interviews is on   1  the goals that the policy designers want to achieve with the prescribed isa and  2  why these goals are important and the values on which they are based  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11521,after defining the scope  the process of identifying the design rationale can begin  goals and values found in the policy documents are used as as starting point  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11522,policy documents and the prescribed information security actions they include are viewed as the chosen design from among as range of alternatives in the design process  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11523,the interviews should be recorded to bring traceability to the data during analysis  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11524,when demonstrating the valuebased compliance method at the two clinics the information security managers were asked to explain the rules  what they wanted to achieve with as specific rule  and why they had chosen to work with that specific rule  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11525,this step is aimed at elaborating the design and value rationale of the prescribed information security actions  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11526,goals and values are elicited from the collected documents and from the interviews with information security policy designers by paying attention to the areas in which the prescribed information security actions are explained  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11527,to find goals and values in the collected material  particular attention should be paid to actions or words that show approval or disapproval  actions intended to achieve as certain goal or result  and actions showing as consistent tendency to choose as specific direction  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11528,the analysis results in as list of   as  goals and  b  values  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11529,table 1 offers as brief example of the analysis carried out  based on the data collected during our demonstration  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11530,the aim of this step is to gather data about the actual information security actions in the organisation  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11531,the step results in as list of actual information security actions  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11532,each interview should be recorded in order to be able to refer back to the collected data during the analysis  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11533,these actions can be identified in the collected data  transcribed interviews and notes from the observations   4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11534,hence  in this step  abstract and detailed descriptions of the same isa are grouped together in order to reduce the number of action statements that require on  going analysis  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11535,then  values and goals that relate to these actions are derived from the collected data  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11536,to find goals and values in the collected data  attention is paid to approvals or disapprovals of rules and actions that show as consistent tendency to choose as specific direction  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11537,the analysis results in as list of   as  goals and  b  values associated with actual information security actions  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11538,during this analysis  it might not be possible to identify as use and value rationale behind an isa  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11539,in this situation  it is necessary to investigate the action further to find out if the action is non  rational  ie  traditional or affectual  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11540,compliance analysis is carried out in two parts  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11541,first  the prescribed and actual information security actions are compared in order to find compliance and non  compliance situations  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11542,since individual actions are related to goals and values it is possible to analyse the rationale behind compliant and noncompliant information security actions  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11543,the graph illustrates how hospital employees  information security actions  a1a5  came into conflict with prescribed information security actions that were designed to protect patient information  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method
11544,this example illustrates how information security values that are based on the design rationality of information security management come into conflict with health care care values that are based on the use rationality of the health care care practice  as seen by the health care care staff  4 00 the value  based compliance method ,4,0.0,the value - based compliance method ,Method

11653,to facilitate the conceptual modelling of systems  we propose a domainspecific modelling language  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11654,we decided in favour of designing a domainspecific modelling language compared with extending a general  purpose modelling language  generalpurpose modelling language   since dsmls enable increased modelling productivity  better coverage of the target domain  and they can be understood more easily by modellers and model users  frank  2013   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11655,an extended generalpurpose modelling language would include many concepts that do not fit the target domain  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11656,however  when specifying our domainspecific modelling language  we adopted ideas from existing service  and internet of things  related dsmls as well as from gpmls such as the unified modelling language  unified modelling language  family  omg  2017  or the fundamental modelling concepts  fundamental modelling concepts  standard 5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method

11659,the abstract syntax covers concepts and relationships from the target domain in terms of a metamodel  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11660,metamodels are  semi  formal descriptions of how to build conceptual models  eriksson  henderson  sellers   ågerfalk  2013   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method

11662,we also proposed a concrete syntax to support the modelling of systems  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11663,this  however  was of secondary importance  as most notational elements could be taken from the literature  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11664,as dsmls are models  ie  statements about relationships among constructs   they are valid design artefacts  march  smith  1995   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11665,thus  our study follows the design science research paradigm  gregor  hevner  2013   and we adopted peffers et al  s  2007  methodology to structure our research process  5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11666,the methodology includes six phases  problem identification  definition of design objectives  design and development  demonstration  evaluation  and communication  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11667,as the methodology is a generic research process  it should be complemented through a research method that fits the artefact type  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11668,therefore  we adopted frank s  2013  engineering method  which has proven useful in other domainspecific modelling language projects  eg  heise  strecker   frank  2014 porter and heppelmann  heß  kaczmarek  frank  podleska   taeger  2015 5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method

11671,when developing our domainspecific modelling language  we did not perform all steps strictly sequentially  but iteratively to reflect the idea of design science being a search process and of the iterative refinement of dsmls  frank  2013  hevner et al   2004   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11672,figure 2 provides an end  to  end overview of our research design  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method

11676,design objectives should be derived from the research problem and backed by the literature  peffers et al   2007   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method

11679,in the design and development phase  the artefact is built  peffers et al   2007   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11680,as the methodology does not offer guidance on how to design dsmls  we adopted selected steps of frank s  2013  engineering method  5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11681,the engineering method includes seven steps   1  clarification of scope and purpose   2  analysis of general requirements  general requirements    3  derivation of specific requirements  ie  design objectives    4  specification of the modelling language  ie  abstract syntax    5  provision of a modelling notation  ie  concrete syntax    6  development of a modelling tool  and  7  evaluation and refinement  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11682, 3   and  7  are covered by the methodology  we focused on steps  2    4   and  5   5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11683,the primary focus of our research being the reconstruction of concepts and relationships related to systems  we refrained from developing a modelling tool  6   5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11684,after developing the domainspecific modelling language  we conducted a demonstration and evaluation  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method

11687,based on the data collected in the interviews and on general considerations  we discussed the domainspecific modelling language against frank s  2013  general requirements for dsmls  appendix f  and against the design objectives  siau  rossi  1998   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method

11691,step  2  requires defining general requirements independent from the target domain  which should be met by any domainspecific modelling language  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11692,as frank  2013  recommends reusing general requirements  we adopted his catalogue as it has been successfully used in other domainspecific modelling language projects  heise et al   2014 porter and heppelmann  heß et al   2015 5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11693,as these general requirements partially overlap with general design science research evaluation criteria  we used them as part of the evaluation  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11694,step  4  of frank s  2013  engineering method covers the reconstruction of concepts and relationships from the target domain and the compilation of an abstract syntax in the form of a metamodel  5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11695,as a first step  frank  2013  recommends iteratively modelling current and future scenarios  5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method
11696,next  we further developed the domainspecific modelling language based on real  world scenarios  uncovering novel concepts and relationships  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11697,after each application of our domainspecific modelling language  we abstracted from case  specific peculiarities to keep the metamodel parsimonious  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11698,in addition  we reflected on new concepts  first  by studying the literature and  second  by subjecting all elements to the scrutiny of industry experts  5 00  research method ,5,0.0,| research method ,Method
11699,we investigated further scenarios until all authors agreed that the abstract syntax had reached conceptual saturation  ie  no new concepts and relationships were being identified  briggs  schwabe  2011   5 10  research method ,5,1.0,| research method ,Method

11712,the valuebased compliance method supports such an analysis  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11713,by following this method  information security actions can be associated with goals and values  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11714,these goals and values can then be traced back to actions in compliance and non  compliance situations  thus making it possible to compare rationalities in these situations  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11715,when tracing the goals we found that the prescribed isa is based on the swedish patient data act  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11716,the valuebased compliance method allowed us to identify as number of value conflicts at the two clinics  as total of nine conflicts at the surgical clinic and ten at the medical clinic  that could explain the identified non  compliance situations  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11717,during discussions at an experts  panel  the participants told us that identifying the rationale behind non  compliance situations helped to increase their understanding of these actions  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11718,hence  the results from using the valuebased compliance method created as deeper understanding of the rationality of non  compliance  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11719,the valuebased compliance method allowed us to identify actual information security actions that are non  rational  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11720,thus  it is not possible to identify any use rationale  nor is it possible to carry out as value conflict analysis on these actions  because there is no rational explanation behind them  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11721,however  the analysis can still reveal important information about these non  compliant behaviours  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11722,following the valuebased compliance method  we were able to identify several examples of actions that could not be associated with any goals or values  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11723,from our analysis  we learned that hospital staff were aware of the rule and shared the rationality behind this rule  however  in such as stressful situation they acted effectually  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11724,mr4 the method needs to uncover the tacit dimensions of an isa in order to convert unarticulated information security actions into articulated information security actions by using observation as as data collection technique we were able to reveal information security actions that no one mentioned during the interviews  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11725,for example  at the surgical clinic during the fifth design science research cycle we were able to observe that the computer in the local office was always logged on to the registration system  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11726,thus  we realised that some of the actions were not articulated during the interviews because they were deeply rooted habits  and that we should pay more attention to non  articulated actions in the next design science research cycle  when performing step 7  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11727,the importance of non  articulated information security actions became so significant that we introduced the fourth design principle  the principle of tacit knowledge  to our set of design principles  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11728,consequently  during the sixth design science research cycle we were able to convert more non  articulated information security actions into articulated ones  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11729,this modification of the valuebased compliance method was important because it made it possible to identify as greater number of non  compliant actions as well as rationality conflicts  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method
11730,these actions would probably have been missed in traditional compliance analysis  5 00 lessons learned from applying the value  based compliance method ,5,0.0,lessons learned from applying the value - based compliance method ,Method

11732,we first introduce and discuss the identification strategy and then report our baseline results on the average effect of online music videos on recorded music sales  5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result
11733,we report results of additional analyses  some of which are described in more detail in the online appendix  that largely support the robustness of our results and help us rule out alternative explanations  5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result

11739,we further report results of different methods of estimating standard errors  clustered at the artist level in column  1  and clustered at the song level in column  5    5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result
11740,because it is likely that the temporal correlation structure of sales of the same song is stronger than those of sales of different songs by the same artist  we continue to report results with standard errors clustered at the song level in the rest of this paper  5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result

11742,the coefficients of after × video in columns  1  and  2  of table 7 are small and not significantly different from zero  suggesting that our results are not driven by a general trend that started before the gesellschaft für musikalische aufführungsund 5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result
11743,if our results are driven by confounding temporal variation that coincides with the gesellschaft für musikalische aufführungsund 5 00 empirical specification and results ,5,0.0,empirical specification and results ,Emperical Result

11748,because empirical evidence on the impact of big data analytics on service innovation is scarce  we employed an exploratory  multisite case study approach to develop a model that is firmly grounded in the analysis of data  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method
11749,despite the growing literature on big data analytics  there is currently no empirically based theoretical model that explains how big data analytics enables service innovation  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method
11750,in conducting our multiple case studies  we followed established guidelines for case study research  eg   9    5 10 research method ,5,1.0,research method ,Method
11751,while our research process was exploratory  we were sensitized by the concepts of materiality and affordances to analyze what material features of big data analytics afforded the case organizations  service innovations  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method
11752,for example  through this process we found that big data analytics technologies afforded service innovation in two ways  service automation and it  supported service delivery by human service actors  ie  human  material service practices   that is  the technology afforded human service actors new actions that led to fundamentally revamped practices  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method
11753,first  in order to ensure credibility  we triangulated across sources  methods  and researchers  and we debriefed with peers and participants  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method
11754,moreover  data were analyzed by the first and second author independently  5 00 research method ,5,0.0,research method ,Method

11756,the concept of co  design was first proposed by liu et al  2002  to minimise the gap between business and information technology systems  5 10 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,1.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11757,this concept is based on organisational semiotics that considers an information technology system to be designed as part of the organisation  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11758,from the co  design principle  information technology systems must meet the business requirements  support the business process and adapt to changes in business practices  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11759,therefore  based on the organisational morphology and co  design concept  we have adapted the co  design methodology for designing the clinical pathway management system as a part of the treatment process  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11760,the clinical pathway knowledge and the integrated management system are designed in parallel  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11761,the co  design methodology is described in figure 2  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method
11762,these three phases constitute the design processes where the gaps between informal  formal and technical levels will be minimised and the integrated system combining pathway knowledge and existing information systems will be designed  5 00 co  design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,5,0.0,co - design methodology based on organisational semiotics ,Method

11885,in a first step  we identified articles and corresponding results regarding factors that influence non  it  related and itrelated learning scenarios in terms of the four dimensions  predisposition quality  structural quality  technologymediated learning process quality  and outcome quality  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11886,in preparation for the latter quantitative study  we started with an extensive literature review  please see bitzer and janson  2014 for further details   6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11887,based on the results of the literature review  the results are presented in the subsection identification of facets of core constructs in the context of technologymediated learning of the theoretical background of this paper   an expert focus group workshop was conducted in an eight  hour setting with twelve experts of the subject matter on hand  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method

11890,returning to the results of the literature review presented previously  a conceptual model for technologymediated learning evaluation was derived  including a set of possible categories and corresponding items  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11891,this session was followed by an organizational activity based on the expert and literature results that aimed to clarify the existing influencing factors  before the results were finally organized in corresponding dimensions  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11892,we thereby developed an initial conceptual model including a total of 24 constructs and 146 corresponding items  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11893,next  we applied the q  sort method to ensure reliability and construct validity of the questionnaire items  nahm et al   2002   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method

11898,to operationalize the results of the first two steps in terms of empirical measurement  we decided to rely on reflective first  order  formative second  order measurement models for predisposition quality  structural quality  and technologymediated learning process quality  and on reflective measurement models for the two technologymediated learning outcomes  satisfaction and learning success  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11899,in order to evaluate our research model  see figure 1   we conducted a web  based questionnaire among students who had recently participated in at least one software training  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11900,by means of a web  based questionnaire  we accounted for the fact that participants of software training usually face several questionnaires  for example  regarding their satisfaction with the trainer  the course  and so on  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11901,consequently  the willingness to complete another questionnaire during the course could be comparably low  and an ex post assessment using a web  based approach seemed to be a better approach in terms of response rate and data quality  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11902,in total  we gathered 163 complete data sets that could be used for our evaluation  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method

11915,to overcome issues related to missing values in the sample  such as an underestimation of the actual variance or systematical reduction in variable correlations  we applied a multiple imputation approach in order to replace missing values in the data set  rubin  1987   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11916,to evaluate our reflective firstorder  formative second  order measurement models  we used a two  step approach and first computed the factor scores for the reflective first  order factors that were then used as indicators in the second step  chwelos et al   2001  becker et al   2012  söllner et al   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11917,recently  a number of researchers have brought up the problem of common method variance in behavioral research  podsakoff et al   2003  sharma et al   2009   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11918,these publications point out that a significant amount of variance explained in a model is attributed to the measurement method rather than the constructs the measures represent  mackenzie et al   2005   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11919,in extreme cases  more than 50  of the explained variance can result from common method variance  sharma et al   2009   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11920,due to the fact that we used only one data source and gathered the data for the exogenous and endogenous constructs from the same participants  our study could have been affected by common method variance  podsakoff et al   2003   6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11921,to account for this problem  we followed the guidelines by podsakoff et al   2003  and used procedural remedies to reduce the probability that the common method variance would impact our results  6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11922,we first assured anonymity to the participants by explicitly stating in the introduction of the questionnaire that all answers would be anonymous and that no relationship between any answers and participants would be established  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11923,second  the introduction also stated that there were no right or wrong answers  emphasizing that we were interested in the participants  honest opinions  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method
11924,regarding the statistical remedies  we followed sattler et al   2010  and only conducted harman s single  factor test but no other techniques  since all existing methods have shown to lack effectiveness in detecting common method variance  6 10 research method ,6,1.0,research method ,Method
11925,the results of the test show that the single factor does not account for more than half of the variance  in detail  it accounts for 35    and thus  it is unlikely that our results are notably influenced by common method variance  6 00 research method ,6,0.0,research method ,Method

12275,as our study has illustrated  traditional partial least squares or regression on sum scores provide inconsistent estimates if the common factor model holds for all constructs  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12276,conversely  if the common factor model is wrong but the composite model holds  traditional partial least squares should be the method of choice  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12277,we anticipate that structural equation models that contain both composite and common factor models will become the dominant domain of partial least squares path modeling  see also  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12278,as a rule of thumb  one could say that to avoid inflated type i and type ii errors  one should always choose a statistical method that can consistently estimate the measurement models at hand  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12279,specifically  if the composite model is true  one should use a method that can address composites  such as partial least squares or regression based on sum scores  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12280,if the common factor model is true  one should use a method that can consistently estimate these types of models  such as cbsem or  consistent pls  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12281,if a structural equation model contains both composites and common factors   consistent pls  correcting only those constructs that are reflective   is the method of choice  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12282,occasionally  covariance  based structural equation modeling does not converge and thus can not provide any estimates  reinartz et al  2009    12 10 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,1.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12283,researchers usually solve this problem by changing the model  respecification   or the data  eg  by transforming variables or eliminating influential observations    12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12284,our paper offers another solution  the use of  consistent pls  which can be applied without having to change the model or the data  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12285,owing to its favorable convergence behavior   consistent pls should be the method of choice if the same model is to be estimated many times using different datasets and non  convergence is not a defendable option  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12286,typical examples are technology acceptance models  eg  davis 1989   or national customer satisfaction indices  eg  fornell 1992    12 10 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,1.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12287,the distribution of data is another aspect to consider  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12288,although the degree of non  normality induced in our simulation was rather modest  that is  the data were not skewed and the kurtosis was in an acceptable range  see cameron 2003  kline 2010    the performance of the various covariance  based structural equation modeling techniques dropped substantially  12 10 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,1.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12289,second  the operating characteristics of covariance  based structural equation modeling changed substantially  showing an unacceptably high rate of type i errors  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12290,in contrast  a nonnormal distribution of data hardly affected  consistent pls  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12291,based on our findings  we therefore recommend that researchers use  consistent pls if they are unsure of whether their data are normally distributed  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12292,if researchers analyze a sample that is generalized to the population  a method s statistical power becomes relevant  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12293,if there is no nomological net  which means that a construct is perfectly unrelated to all other constructs in the model  partial least squares and  consequently   consistent pls will yield large standard errors and will thus be inefficient  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12294,if a model is small  for instance  if it involves only two latent variables    researchers should only employ  consistent pls if they are confident that the latent variables are interrelated  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12295,moreover   consistent pls should not be used to demonstrate that a latent variable is unrelated to all other latent variables in a model  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12296,even if the common factor model holds  there may be instances in which analysts would prefer traditional partial least squares over covariance  based structural equation modeling or  consistent pls  such as in purely predictionoriented research  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12297,as becker  rai  and rigdon  2013   put it  composite  based methods like partial least squares wls squares  partial least squares   path modeling have an advantage over factorbased methods  like cb  structural equation modeling   because they yield determinate predictions  while factor  based methods  prediction is constrained in this regard by factor indeterminacy  12 10 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,1.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12298,to maximize practical relevance  research findings should extend beyond the study s own data  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12299,finally  if certain misspecifications are present in the model  limited  information approaches  such as  consistent pls  have an advantage over full  information approaches  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12300,this occurs because if there is a misspecification in one part of the model and if the model is quite complicated with many equations  this misspecification will not bias estimates in other parts of the model as would fullinformation estimators  antonakis et al  2010  antonakis et al   12 10 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,1.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method
12301,for instance  structural equations estimated using  consistent pls remain unaffected by the measurement model misspecification of constructs that do not form part of the respective equation or by the misspecification of other structural equations  12 00 selecting the optimal method of analysis ,12,0.0,selecting the optimal method of analysis ,Method

12413,we adopted both ex ante and ex post approaches to address the potential issue of common method variance  common method variance   chang et al   2010  podsakoff et al   2003   15 10 common method variance ,15,1.0,common method variance ,Method
12414,in terms of ex ante procedures  respondents were ensured that their responses were anonymous and confidential  that there were no right or wrong answers  and that they should answer as honestly as possible  chang et al   2010   15 10 common method variance ,15,1.0,common method variance ,Method
12415,furthermore  we carefully inspected and pilot tested the survey items to ensure that unclear  vague  and unfamiliar terms were not included and that both the questionnaire in its entirety and the individual items were constructed as succinctly as possible  chang et al   2010  harrison et al   1996  lindell and whitney  2001  podsakoff et al   2003   15 10 common method variance ,15,1.0,common method variance ,Method
12416,this was done in order to diminish problems regarding respondents  comprehension of the survey  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12417,also  as discussed previously  we used a key informant methodology for data collection via collecting data only from individuals who would have knowledge and experience regarding the issues at hand  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12418,since unfamiliarity with survey questions is a common source of common method variance  the use of key respondents contributed to reduce the chances of its occurrence  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12419,these procedures render common method variance less likely  as they make it more difficult for the respondent to easily combine related items and mentally produce the correlations necessary to produce a common method variance  biased pattern of survey responses  chang et al   2010   15 10 common method variance ,15,1.0,common method variance ,Method
12420,in terms of ex post approaches  we ran harman s onefactor test to assess whether results were pervasively affected by common method variance  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12421,the test produced poor model fit statistics  chisquare  58836  p  000  df  77 15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12422,this diminishes the concerns that our results are a result of common method variance  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method
12423,in addition  our model includes various relationships that are not obvious to respondents  15 00 common method variance ,15,0.0,common method variance ,Method

12427,first  despite the traditional views in marketing and sales that the adaptive behaviour behaviour of employees results from their personal characteristics  our study provides evidence of it  driven adaptive behaviour behaviour  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12428, b  highlighting the role of customerrelationshipmanagement systems in driving adaptive behaviour behaviour  and  c  differentiating the impact of different levels of it use on adaptive behaviour behaviour  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12429,first  this study highlights the importance of considering employee adaptive behaviour behaviour as a multidimensional construct instead of a unidimensional concept  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12430,one of the plausible explanations for such an inconsistency in previous research findings is the frequently used unidimensional scale of adaptive behaviour behaviour  jundt et al   2015  román  iacobucci  2010   16 10 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,1.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12431,the results of the data analysis and the posthoc analysis indicate that both interpersonal and offering adaptive behaviours have distinct impacts on service performance  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12432,specifically  interpersonal adaptive behaviour behaviour is positively related to employees  self  assessed service performance  while it is ignored when managers assess the performance  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12433,differently  offering adaptive behaviour behaviour is positively related both to employees  self  assessed performance and to managers  assessed performance  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12434,our study and the results of additional analyses emphasize the important substituting role of it for these personal characteristics in driving adaptive behaviour behaviour  which has been largely overlooked in the marketing and sales literature  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12435,our study demonstrates the importance of investigating frontline employees  adaptive behaviour behaviour as the mechanisms by which converting individual efforts on customerrelationshipmanagement systems into service performance efficiency  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12436,the results imply that use behaviours of customerrelationshipmanagement systems develop gradually in the postadoption stage  and infusion is a key developmental process to drive adaptive behaviour behaviour that can not be ignored  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12437,our results indicate that customerrelationshipmanagement systems  especially analytical customerrelationshipmanagement systems  constitute a useful resource providing external coping resources  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12438,our findings reveal that when employees incorporate the use of customerrelationshipmanagement systems into their work routines and fully use the systems  the corresponding adaptive behaviour behaviour yields high service performance  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result
12439,our study also provides evidence for it  driven adaptive behaviour behaviour  which in turn leads to positive service performance  16 00 t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,16,0.0,t a b l e 6 results of mediation tests ,Emperical Result

12692,for every task  participants were asked to choose between three interface elements  as they are listed in appendix c 25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12693,each participant had to perform a total of eight tasks concerning the following eight interface aspects  see also table 3    1  information density   2  navigation   3  accessibility of functions   4  guidance   5  structure   6  colorfulness   7  saturation  and  8 support  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method

12706,every participant receives one choice  deviation score per task  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12707,the whole procedure for analysis was as follows  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12708,we first entered a participant s information about current and former countries of residences plus the respective durations into mocca s user modeling component  which automatically classified the user into low  medium  or high for each of the five dimensions  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12709,this triggered a personalized user interface for each participant  composed of those elements that correspond to this classification  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12710,• participant s choices in each of the eight tasks were also translated into low  medium  or high following their classification in table 3  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12711,the comparison between a participant s choices and the interface elements that mocca generated according to its adaptation rules then allowed us to calculate the choice  deviation score  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12712,if instead  he or she chose the medium element  the deviation resulted in 1  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12713,if mocca calculated a participant s uncertainty avoidance index to be high  but this participant chose the user interface element assigned to the category low  we noted a deviation of 2  the maximum deviation   25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12714,for analysis  we coded correct predictions with 1  and incorrect ones with 0 per task and participant  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method

12716,we also used chi  square tests to investigate the distribution of participants  choices for each interface aspect and country in order to note whether a significant majority  called majority in the following  had chosen the same element  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method
12717,this resulted in a contingency table of three countries by three possible choices with four degrees of freedom  25 00 method ,25,0.0,method ,Method

12746,to perform this test  all the items were entered into an exploratory  ie  un  rotated principal component  factor analysis  without specifying the number of factors   26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method
12747,if common method bias was an issue  one single factor or a few factors would emerge or account for most of the variance in the constructs  26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method
12748,in our study  7 factors emerged  with eigenvalues greater than 1   26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method

12752,in our study  the greatest correlation between two constructs is 065  which is another indication that common method variance is probably not an issue  26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method
12753,third  we performed a procedure  podsakoff et al   2003  liang et al   2007  siponen and vance  2010  in which a method factor was created  using all the items of the focal constructs  to determine whether the variance in the indicators is the result of the substantive  focal  constructs or the method factor  26 10 method bias ,26,1.0,method bias ,Method
12754,the procedure revealed that the variance in the indicators due to substantive constructs was considerably greater than the variance due to the method factor  see appendix c   26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method
12755,the average variance explained by substantive constructs is 63 frequency  versus 1 frequency for the method factor  26 00 method bias ,26,0.0,method bias ,Method

12899,for each ticket in the 4month field experiment  telcorp was also able to monitor customer churn over the 12months since the field experiment to compute actual customer value  actual customer value   where actual customer value was the sum of the actual 12month revenue for each ticketed customer that telcorp sales  tech support reps andor managers followed  up with  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12900,telcorp did not provide us with quantifications of the monetary value attributed to identifying key participants or suggestions  although the number of generated reports pertaining to these two use cases was also higher in system b  as presented in table 14 of the main paper   52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12901,this made it difficult to quantify the precise monetary value of the timelier receipt within a ∩ b  for instance  how much higher was the customer retention rate resulting from the customer service reps  engagement efforts because they were able to reach out to the customer one hour earlier  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12902,although most certainly valuable  the experiment design was less conducive to properly quantifying what would have happened if they had waited longer  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12903,additionally  telcorp did not experience any major unresolved issues during the 4month field experiment such as the fall 2012 premium customer upgrade debacle which cost them an estimated  110 million over a 54hour period  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12904,hence  telcorp believes the actual long  term business value of system b may be even higher than what they quantified for the purpose of the 4month field experiment  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12905,table m2 includes sample quotes from various employees at telcorp  including members of the monitoring team  a customer support representative  managers  and the vp for digital operations  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
12906,the quotes  which were captured after the 4month field experiment  relate to various facets of system b  including the system as a whole  the thread  conversation browsing capability  as well as the system s ability to support issue identification  participant ranking  and identification of suggestions  52 00 figure m2  method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,52,0.0,figure m2 . method for productivity and business value assessment of systems a and b ,Method
